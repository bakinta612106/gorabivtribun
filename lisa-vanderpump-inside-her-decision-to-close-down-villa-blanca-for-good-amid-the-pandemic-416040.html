It was her baby and she frequented there almost daily,’ the insider dished.</p><p>Previously, they were signs put up at the restaurant, that it would be closed temporarily, stressing how important that was in order to try and flatten the curve of the infections.</p><p>However, last week, <a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a> revealed that the place she had run with her husband Ken Todd for no less than 12 years, would be closed for good.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9z98XNp_K9/</p><p>‘They held onto it so long because they didn’t want to see it close. The restaurant has not been doing well for a while now and their other establishments were doing much better. It’s always been more of a lunch and happy hour spot and never really was packed. The rent for that corner in Beverly Hills is insanely expensive, too,’ the same source explained.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It really sounds like it was a hard decision to make but at least the star couple also owns TomTom, Sur and Pump and if all goes as planned, Lisa should be able to reopen later this summer.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecnsCiedWapZ2doqXCrryMoqWsoZSaeqmx0WabnpuZqLawuoytpmabnKTApnnDqK6nZaaeua2tjJujmqaTlnqnu9FmnqinlGKurrXDZquhnV2lrq%2BwxKagnGVkZoNxgI9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
