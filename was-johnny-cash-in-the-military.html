R. Cash</a>, and forced to change it to John. R Cash to enlist, Johnny Cash did not receive his final stage name until he signed to Sun Records in 1955.</p><p>Cash was born in Arkansas, and graduated high school in 1950, just in time for the Korean War. Many men during that time waited to be drafted for a two year service sentence, yet Cash enlisted for four.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To see a video compilation of Johnny Cash singing “I Won’t Back Down” dedicated to the United States Armed Force, see below.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Journey&nbsp;</h2><p>July 7, 1950 was the day that J. R. Cash enlisted in the Air Force and left his home state to go to Texas for <a href=# rel=noopener>training</a>. He received basic training at Lackland Air Force Base and continued on to technical training at Brooks Air Force Base.&nbsp;</p><p>After all his training in San Antonio, he was sent to Landsberg, Germany, or more specifically southern <a href=# rel=noopener>Bavaria</a>, where he was a <a href=# rel=noopener>Morse Code Intercept Operator</a>. During his training in Texas, he met his future wife, Vivian Liberto, whom he only dated three weeks before being sent overseas.</p><p>They exchanged letters for years and married after his return in ‘54. However, his relationship with her was not the only momentous aspect of these four years.</p><p>While there, he was only allowed one phone call per year and was totally detached and was totally on his own. He used his military pay and treated himself to a <a href=# rel=noopener>guitar</a>.</p><p>He saw the film “Inside Folsom Prison” and felt he could largely relate to the feeling of being a prisoner in his current position since he was in a confidential, Security Service unit in the 12th Radio Squadron Mobile. He was very <a href=# rel=noopener>successful at his job</a> as well, and was one of the first to hear news of Stalin’s death.&nbsp;</p><p>After seeing the film, he wrote his famous song “Folsom Prison Blues” and he even started his band called “<a href=# rel=noopener>The Landsberg Barbarians</a>.” He would play for the GIs and local Germans, and at events that packed the local officer club.</p><p>To hear Johnny Cash’s infamous “Folsom Prison Blues, ” listen on Spotify below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-spotify wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Link from Military to Music</h2><p>Johnny Cash was honorably discharged in July of 1954 and returned to Texas.&nbsp;</p><p>It is no surprise that Johnny Cash had such a successful music career after his job in the military. It is said that people who work with signal codes have a <a href=# rel=noopener>strong correlation</a> to musical ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is an art and a musical cadence to <a href=# rel=noopener>Morse code</a>. It can be melodic and soothing to some, identical to that of a song.&nbsp;</p><p>It shows that since Cash had the <a href=# rel=noopener>capacity</a> to discern rhythms and resonance in a sea of mangled, confusing noise, it gave him the ability to perform, write, and sing in a way that resonated with many individuals for years to come.</p><p>Johnny Cash toured Vietnam with the U.S. State Department and often played for the troops as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To hear a bit of how Morse Code has musical tendencies to it, watch the video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCYrGWapLWvuthmmpqrmGK2r3nToZxmpZmhtrWt0bJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
