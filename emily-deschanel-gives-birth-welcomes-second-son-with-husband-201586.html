The actress' pregnancy overlapped with that of her equally famous younger sister<strong> Zooey Deschanel</strong>, <a href=#>who is currently expecting her first baby</a> with her fiancé, <strong>Jacob Pechenik.</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Already well-versed in motherhood, Emily handled pregnancy like a pro during round two. "I work with a nutritionist to make sure I have the protein that I need," the vegan actress told<strong> Us</strong> in December, elaborating that lemonade was what she craved most.</p><p>"It's so weird," she added. "I just get thirsty. You have to drink more water and I can only drink so much water. I used to drink a ton of [fluids] and now I've hit my limit so I think of a variety. Once I get thirsty, I'll want lemonade or a sparkling water. Maybe it is citrus fruits!"</p><p>The mom of two told<strong> Us</strong> at the same event that she was keeping the baby's gender a mystery — for the time being. "I know that it'll happen in the next couple of episodes we're filming, but that's it," she told <strong>Us</strong>. "I don't know if it'll be a boy or a girl."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJymoZyueqWx0pyfmqaVoXqotdWeqmaamafBqXnWnqOcp52awG6%2FxJymp5xdqLyvedaiq6FlmKrAo63NnWRraGFqhXc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
