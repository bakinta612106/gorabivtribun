Spurred by Republican senators voting against the Senate bill to help veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, Stewart made several appearances on Capitol Hill last week into early this week, when on Monday he was filmed shouting at right-wing conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and calling him a “fucking troll” not acting “in good faith."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After playing the clip, Carlson said Stewart looked “like a guy who lives in the men’s room at your public library, eating imaginary insects out of the air.”</p><p>Carlson didn’t bother to explain why Stewart was there. In fact, the Fox host actually mischaracterized Stewart’s purpose on Capitol Hill, claiming he showed up to yell at Posobiec. “He was there to get—for some reason—into a shouting match” with the fringe figure, as Carlson framed it.</p><p>He then diminished the significance of the legislation that he failed to describe. “What’s really the most interesting part of [the video] is not the policy debate,” Carlson said, using a mocking tone for those last two words, “but Jon Stewart himself. He’s totally unrecognizable. He looks demented.”</p><p>Carlson wasn’t done, though. After a few more comments about Stewart’s appearance, Carlson fixated on his height. Stewart, he said, is “very short. Really short. Too short to date. Was he always that short?”</p><p>Stewart responded to Carlson on Twitter late Thursday night. The primetime Fox host “believes me too short to date… and yet somehow, miraculously, I remain tall enough to not know what Victor Orban’s ass tastes like!” Stewart wrote, referencing Carlson’s <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>frequent praise</a> for Hungary’s <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>authoritarian prime minister</a>, who <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>warned against</a> a “mixed-race world” in a speech last month.</p><p>In an MSNBC interview last Thursday, Stewart also <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>skewered Fox News</a> for not having him on to discuss the PACT Act. The network responded by booking him the following morning, during which Stewart explained the legislation <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>while throwing in a few quips at Fox</a> for good measure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKqwrLHRZpqaqpyovK95zKipnmWZo8GmvsSsq56cXZ67brbOp2SsrJWsrrPA0mafnqGXncFuwMeapWaulamys63NZp%2BemZyptW6vwKucZpqZoblutMRmmJ2un5iutbHDZp2oql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
