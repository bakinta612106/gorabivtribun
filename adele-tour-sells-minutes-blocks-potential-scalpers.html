The same thing happened earlier this month with the UK and European tickets.</p><p>While this was no surprise to most people, some fans were frustrated to be online for quite some time, only to find out that the tickets were already gone.&nbsp;Ticketmaster caught most of the flack, but it was determined that the site was fully functional and had no technical problems during the sale period.</p>The hashtag <a href=#>#adelesoldout</a> trended on Twitter for some time. Of course, in usual Twitter fashion, memes, GIFs, and other media were used to talk about the record breaking artist. Despite the frustration of trying to get tickets, Adele and her team did take steps that helped prevent scalpers from&nbsp;reselling the tickets. Teaming up with Songkick, she&nbsp;arranged for a lot of&nbsp;tickets to be sold through&nbsp;her <a href=#>website</a>. Songkick was able to block 53,000 known scalpers from buying the tickets, saving fans $6.3 million dollars.<p>This year has been stellar for Adele.&nbsp; The video for&nbsp;“Hello” broke&nbsp;Vevo’s record for most views within 24 hours (it was previously held by Taylor Swift for “Bad Blood”).&nbsp;25 sold another 750,000 copies last week, and is at its 3rd week at #1 on the Billboard charts. Now, with her tour tickets gone so fast,&nbsp;it seems as if 2016 is going to be as wonderful as 2015 was for the Grammy winner.</p>Are you going to see Adele, or did you get your tickets a little too late? Do you think that more artists should try to prevent scalpers?
