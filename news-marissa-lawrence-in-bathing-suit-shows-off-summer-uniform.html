"It is a game of continuous running and with very little stopping," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Dr. Mercedes Carnethon</span></a><span>, an associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago. "It also has anaerobic elements ‚Äì that high intensity where you're sprinting and then resting ‚Äì you're constantly moving."</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/pexels-taryn-elliott-5107161.jpg><p><span>Lawrence loves cooking at home, especially dishes made with chicken. Her biggest indulgence is bread. "When people cook most of their meals at home, they consume fewer carbohydrates, less sugar and less fat than those who cook less or not at all ‚Äì even if they are not trying to lose weight," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Julia A. Wolfson, MPP</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Lawrence works as an event planner. "If your work is stable, and you're good at it, it can help you stay even-keeled when other things in your life are stressful (e.g., you're caring for a sick relative, going through infertility, or recovering from a breakup)," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Alice Boyes, PhD</span></a><span>. "Sometimes people don't fully appreciate this benefit until they hit a rocky point in life."</span></p><p><span>Lawrence considers her dogs part of the family. "Ongoing research is showing that the health benefits of owning a dog are undeniable," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Harvard Health</span></a><span>. "Dog owners have lower blood pressure and healthier cholesterol levels, and a lower risk of heart disease, than non-owners."</span></p><p><span>Red wine is Lawrence's go-to drink when she's enjoying date night with her husband. "Red wine is sometimes seen as a healthy choice, particularly as we associate it with the Mediterranean diet," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says dietitian Victoria Taylor</span></a><span>. "But while it is often included in the traditional diet, it isn't an essential part and should be drunk in moderation."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkppminsC0rYylmLCqlaOwpnnIp2SbmaSdtq%2BzjKysoqxdqLWww9Jmpp%2BeXajCrrnEq2SuppmbvLO5jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
