— Sturdy runner with impressive balance. Regularly absorbs contact and keeps moving forward.
— Excellent vision and footwork. Smart, controlled runner who marries patience with decisiveness.
— Efficiently uses the space afforded to him between the tackles. Runs tight to blocks; can get skinny through the hole.
— Tough as nails."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Though he isn't a bulldozer, Johnson's strength matches his frame. He plays with impressive balance, allowing him to absorb hits and continue moving forward.</p><p>Johnson is also an incredibly smart runner, both with zone runs and gap runs. He is patient without being conservative and decisive without being rash. Johnson runs with quick, controlled feet that allow him to switch between rushing lanes and commit down the field with ease. He also does well to run tight to his blocks and squeeze through narrow spaces when need be.</p><p>With that being said, Johnson struggles to generate yards at the second and third level.</p><p>Johnson severely lacks burst in his game. He takes too long to get going on perimeter runs or when he decides to bounce a play outside. The same is true when Johnson gets a runway in the open field. He does not accelerate to his top speed very quickly, and his top speed won't be scaring anybody in the NFL.</p><p>Johnson also lacks mobility in his hips and ankles. When he needs to turn and make a sharp cut up the field, he struggles to do it on one collective motion. Johnson needs a few steps to gather himself to make the turn.</p><p>Johnson can be a good innings-eater type of back in the NFL. He can be a safe, reliable battering ram on a handful of carries per game. However, Johnson lacks the explosive traits necessary to be a difference-maker in the league.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 5.6 (Backup/Draftable — 6th/7th Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 222</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: RB16</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Alex Collins</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWyAenyMnaClpJ%2Bjequ7x6eqqKZdo7OtecOrmJ%2BsXWd9c4CMrJqoraSeu6h50Z6nqKqkYrOwvoytnKemlajAprGMraCtmZ6oerOu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
