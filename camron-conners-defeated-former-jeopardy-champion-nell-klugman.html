Aired on HBO on April 4th, with a fresh set of participants. Nell Klugman, the defending champion, faced up against two newcomers, Camron Conners and Sarah Cahalan. Unfortunately, Klugman was unable to retain his championship, as it was won by Conners before the conclusion of the program. The new champion is a high school social studies teacher.</p><p>Conners, from Rancho San Margarita, California, won the tournament and earned home $24,200. Despite the fact that he did not successfully answer the Final Jeopardy question, he received a bigger payout than the other participants.</p><h2>What was the answer to the Final Jeopardy question?</h2><p>One of the most anticipated rounds on the program is the Final Jeopardy question. The three competitors must guess the question after the presenter provides a hint, and then they stake a certain amount from their cash award. They have nothing to lose if they win, but if they do not correctly guess the question, the betting amount is taken from the reward money.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Camron-Conners-1.jpg alt="Camron Conners" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The final round of questions on Monday came in the area of “Current Television.” Mayim Bialik, the show’s host, dropped a hint:</p><p>“It’s fitting that the family’s surname at the heart of this story is derived from the French word for ‘King.'”</p><p>The right answer was “Succession,” and Nell Klugman and Sarah Cahalan provided it. Conners, on the other hand, made no guesses and simply wrote:</p><p>“What exactly are they?”</p><p>He spent $400 on the round. Therefore his prize money dropped from $24,600 to $24,200 since he didn’t respond properly.</p><h2>Who were Camron Conners’s opponents?</h2><p>Conners faced up against returning champion Nell Klugman on the night. On the April 1 program, the museum educator from Brooklyn, New York, won the championship. Her total for the day was $24,401.&nbsp;Klugman participated in the most recent show and earned $1,400 despite answering incorrectly three times out of seven. She battled against Conners, a high school social studies teacher, and Sarah Cahalan, a news assistant. The latter is from Logansport, Indiana, and she won $5,400 after successfully answering all eight of her questions.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Final Jeopardy! is the perfect time to go full beast. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@HBO</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/6dDgUGpWBH</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MU8djuC3Zh</a></p><p>— Jeopardy!

Despite responding correctly in the last round, the women were defeated by Conners in the competition series.&nbsp;For those who are unfamiliar, Jeopardy! is a game show that debuted on NBC in 1964. According to the series’ official synopsis:</p><p>“The presenter evaluates the participants’ knowledge on a variety of topics, and the winner receives the title and the prize money.”</p><p></p><p>Following Monday’s broadcast on HBO, the next episode of the Emmy-winning program will run on Tuesday, April 5.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiamqWipLtur86npZ6qo2KxprLEmquenF2bvLO5xKtko52fpa6zsNhmmqGZnaW2sLqMp5ylpF2gubazzJqlaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
