Maybe he is a little jealous Bunny always gets priority place in the bed. He thinks I am asleep and he’ll throw Bunny out of bed and I get very cross with him.’</p><p>The star went on to talk about getting starstruck by Nicole Kidman on the set of their new film.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘I remember thinking, ‘Holy s**t, that’s why she is Nicole Kidman. The second they called action, she became this crazy presence. I could not take my eyes off her. Everything that she said, even if it was not a terribly profound line it just felt powerful. And I was like woah. It was very cool to witness first-hand. I remember just thinking like, ‘Okay, I get it. I get why she’s who she is because that’s magical.’’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedlr%2Bou9Nmqaiakp6ybr7Er5yapKNiwKmxjKyroqScYsCtscSpqmavmam1brTEq2Sfmaakv6rAxGaqra2Wm7KledOosGarmJrAbrTAnWSsoZ6Ysm6uyKuroWVjaYZ6hZRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
