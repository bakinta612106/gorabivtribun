We sat with him in our home for hours and changed his clothes. It was summer; I put shorts on him, and a T-shirt out of habit. I chose one of his softest, coziest ones," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said Forrest on Today</a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a id=https://briefly.co.za/8119-new-facebook-algorithm-how-briefly-news-news-feed-now.html#8119 href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><p class=align-left>Forrest carried the late Henry herself when <a href=#>people</a> from the funeral home came to get his body. It was nothing new to her because had carried him hundreds of times as he was like an appendage to her owing to his disability.</p>"We were physically intertwined due to his disability and him needing me to move him around, to be his legs," she said on February 22.<h2>Forrest created a last routine</h2><p class=align-left>Ever since the little angel was born, his mother had clung to routine and schedules so that she could control what could not be controlled.</p>"Without even realizing what I was doing, I created one last routine for us," she said.<p class=align-left>The funeral home allowed Forrest to see her son every day from 9 am to 5 pm for a week.</p>"I’d go into the room and cry, stroke his hair, face and rest my head next to his. I brought a different assortment of books and toys each time. I’d push the buttons on the toys and listen to the sounds, which I had heard so many times when he had pushed them," she said."Henry loved music. I sang some of his favourite songs and played others on my phone. Who Let the dogs out and a variety of Katy Perry and Lizzo songs felt disjointed … and at the same time, perfectly right in the little room where I sat with him," she added.<p class=align-left>Each time, Forrest would stay for about one hour.</p><h2>Henry was cremated.</h2><p class=align-left>One day his father tagged along as well and Forrest could hear him talking to the body of the boy. Earlier on, he had expressed reservations because he was unsure of how the visits would affect her.</p>"Grief makes you do some seemingly weird things. Or maybe grief makes us behave in a way that is our truest self because every impulse I had felt completely organic," she said.<p class=align-left>Henry was eventually cremated, and his ashes were scattered at a tree in a park that he loved.</p>"On the day of the cremation, we went multiple times to sit with him," said Forrest.<h2>AKA’s mother Lynn Forbes pens touching note to the Megacy following the rapper’s assassination in Durban</h2><p class=align-left>In more news, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that AKA's mother penned a touching note to the Megacy.
