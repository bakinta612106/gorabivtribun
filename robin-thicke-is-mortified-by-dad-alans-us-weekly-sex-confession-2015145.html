"You have to admit, it's a great song to get in the mood."</p><p>Once word of his dad’s loose lips got to Robin, the sexy singer was more than mortified. "Dad, I heard what you said to @usweekly… I need you to give back all of my music. Immediately. @Alan_Thicke," he tweeted Thursday.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Dad, I heard what you said to <a href=#>@usweekly</a>… I need you to give back all of my music. Immediately. <a href=#>@Alan_Thicke</a></p><p>— Robin Thicke (@robinthicke) <a href=#>May 14, 2015</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though Alan divorced Robin’s mom, Gloria Loring, when his son was 7, dad’s way with the ladies was the stuff of legend in the Thicke household. "My dad was single my whole pubescent period," the "Love After War" songwriter told Elle in 2013. "He had Ms. Alabama, Ms. Dominican Republic — every week. I was like, Dang, Pops. He had an indoor Jacuzzi, and he frequented it."</p><p>Robin says his father, who was also married to Miss World 1990 Gina Tolleson for five years, "was always very intuitive" with women. "And very smooth," he adds. "He didn't really tell me what to do. He told me what not to do, which is actually more important."</p><p>Unsually Thicke airs on Pop Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmompmjerW0yJyinmWZqHquu9GtoJ%2BhlZl6o8WMnZidZZGhrq%2B%2FjK6qZq%2BVmritxYysnLFlk6S7p7HSrKCopl1nfXKBkG1s</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
