Who will save the sector from the imminent risk of massive loss of funds and fraud?</p><p>Our sources have indicated that in the next few days, a detailed list of all the SACCOs that have placed huge deposits will be released to the public.</p><p>It is important to note that KUSCCO does not have funds to honor the maturing deposits and has, for a long time, been rolling over the funds with higher interests.</p><p>Currently, the DCI and the EACC have been invited to commence criminal investigations against the management team and other leaders who have been part of risking the members’ funds.</p><p>The days ahead may be turbulent for the embattled KUSCCO CEO and his management, but also painful decisions will have to be made to restore confidence in the SACCO subsector.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifKzB0pyaqGWUmr2wv8itZK2Zm567qHnSnJinnJGheqm71maam6NdmsWxu9Kem2alpaHBqnnBoqOloZ%2Bjeqe%2BwK6baA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
