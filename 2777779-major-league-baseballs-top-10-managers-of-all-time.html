He couldn't quite get the Red Sox to the postseason, though, finishing one game out of first place in both 1948 and 1949.</p><p>Though his entire career was impressive, there's no question his apex came with the 1936-43 Yankees.

With the exception of missing the World Series in 1940, they won the American League by at least a nine-game margin each season.</p><p>McCarthy's career winning percentage during the regular season is the best in MLB history, and his postseason winning percentage (.698) is the best among managers who have been to the postseason at least three times.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Kerry Miller is a multisport writer for Bleacher Report.
