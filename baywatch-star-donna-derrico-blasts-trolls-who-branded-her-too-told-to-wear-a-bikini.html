Let me tell you something that might surprise you. I can actually wear and do literally whatever I want. On that note, here is me in a bikini squatting on a coffee table (sic)”</p><p>Several stars shot to Donna’s defence, including producer Tracey Bregman.</p><p>She commented: “Gorgeous and F anyone who tries to tear you down. You look incredible period”</p><p>’90 Day Fiance’ star David Tobrowsky wrote: “Be you. You are an amazing person no matter what [red heart emoji] Annie and I just adore you”</p><p>Last year, Donna told how she can’t swim and only got the part as a lifeguard because her co-star David Hasselhoff (Mitch Buchannon) intervened when she failed the swim test.</p><p>She said: “To this day, I still can’t swim. I’m terrified of water. I can’t even tread water. You get to be part of the most-watched show in the world. And there I am, knowing full well that I cannot swim.”</p><p>But the former Playboy model seemed to know the role was too good to pass up on so she took swimming lessons in an effort to improve her skills – but to no avail.</p><p>Donna claims Hasselhoff threatened to tell the producers she couldn’t swim and how she even had lessons at 5am “five days a week”.</p><p>She said: “It was supposed to be basic, not at all technical. But all I kept thinking was, ‘What on earth am I supposed to do?’ I was told, ‘Get in the pool and do a couple of laps to warm up’.</p><p>“I’m holding on to the edge like a terrified child. And finally, David’s like, ‘Donna, get out of the pool. You can’t swim’. My initial reaction was, ‘Are you going to tell the producers?</p><p>“And he’s like, ‘Well, yeah, of course. This is a show about lifeguards!’</p><p>“I was so upset because I didn’t want to miss out. So I took swimming lessons with their main guy five times a week at five o’clock in the morning in that pool.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOm5iyr5GpsKl50q2Yq2WUpLuvrYydnKuqmZi8bq7Lmqqtq12pv7C4y6xksKCfYq%2Bzrc2dnJ1lmJq%2FbsDOqGStp5yZerW7jLCcmqpdlnqjtcqipaJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
