Joe seems to be in good spirits and they really have a great relationship. I mean when they talk, they talk like best friends. Like nothing’s ever changed. It’s really nice.’</p><p>The cook book author also discussed the type of man she would love to see her co-star dating now that she is single and ready to mingle.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘I think she’s going to just take her time just to be respectful for her daughters, you know, cause it’s going to take a minute for them to realize that their parents are no longer together. That’s the furthest thing on Teresa’s mind right now is dating. But of course I’d love to see her happy in the future and I think that’s a possibility for her. But she’s been married for such a long time, so I’m going to try to tell her to just relax a minute, let it sink in and enjoy being single and not having to answer to anybody,’ Jennifer shared with the same site.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamruvtcWeqWaZqZm2r3nRnq2emZyoerW0wK1kq6Cfo7dur85mqq2ZomLBpr7ErJhmn5mqsaqvxGaYp5xdnbKzecSxZKOnlWKus7GMm5ysrF2bv6qxzZ2qZpmWqbKzedKpo6KsXWiFdX2Qb2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
