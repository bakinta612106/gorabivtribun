SA only.”<p class=align-left>Annette "Jefe" Elhannora responded:</p>“I think it’s for evidence.”<p class=align-left>Sicario pointed out:</p>“And the officer entertains it.”<p class=align-left>OT Kunene jok4d:</p>“The officer is busy collecting exhibits.”<p class=align-left>Demolition wrote:</p>“Only in SA do the cops record.”<p class=align-left>DStarhammer pointed out:</p>“Love the Metro cop making a clip and not doing their job.”<p class=align-left>Maverick was puzzled.</p>“And it’s a joke? Is the cop filming or social media jokes or what? Because she’s not controlling the situation.”<p class=align-left>Soza (Marc) observed:</p>“What else is new? Law enforcement will stand by and watch as the crime is committed and think that it’s funny.”<p class=align-left>Victor suggested:</p>“This officer must be charged for dereliction of her duties.”<p class=align-left>Mo001:</p>“We are normalising crime. This is not good. So whenever a truck is struck, people loot?”<h2>Police assault man in viral video</h2><p class=align-left>In a similar article, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that <a href=#>police officers assaulted a man</a> in a viral video.</p><p class=align-left>The officers pounced on the victim, who works at a salon in <a href=#>Cape Town</a>, and allegedly accused him of selling drugs.
