The Pretty Little Liars prom may have been fairy tale-themed, but Tuesday night's episode, "Last Dance,” wasn't all corsages and gorgeous gowns. (Though there was plenty of those as well.) Cryptic texts, another Red Coat sighting, an abduction — this prom had all the makings for a Charles DiLaurentis-worthy affair. But then again, we all know how he feels about dances. Let's dig in!</p><p><strong>Parental Control</strong></p><p>For a show that's never really put much stock in parental supervision, the PLL moms sure did get a lot of screen time this week. Though, to be honest, they did a lot less supervising and a lot more drinking. After the Liars were banned from attending their senior prom, the moms decided to arrange a little makeshift dance for the girls in Spencer's (<strong>Troian Bellisario</strong>) family barn. However, it took the Liars all of five seconds to give their moms (and the cops) the slip.</p><p>Not that their moms would've noticed, though. Thanks to Veronica Hastings' (<strong>Lesley Fera</strong>) one too many glasses of wine, she decided to go over to the DiLaurentis house and confront Kenneth <strong>(Jim Abele</strong>) about who really killed Jessica. But after a brief — and super shady — run-in with Rhys Matthews (<strong>Caleb Lane</strong>), the PLL moms soon found themselves on the receiving end of A's mind games for a change, and ended up getting trapped in the DiLaurentis basement. (You know how the saying goes: Like mother, like daughter!)</p><p><strong>Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes!</strong></p><p>We knew senior year would signify the start of some major changes in these Liars' lives, and this week finally shed some light on what life will look like for these girls after graduation. For starters, it turns out that Aria (<strong>Lucy Hale</strong>) won that photo competition she had entered, which means she's L.A. bound for an internship right after school ends. Meanwhile, Ezra (<strong>Ian Harding</strong>) announced that he'll be jetting off to Thailand to participate in Habitat for Humanity over the summer.</p><p>And as for Caleb (<strong>Tyler Blackburn</strong>) and Hanna (A<strong>shley Benson</strong>) — aka everyone's all-time favorite PLL couple — well, they're officially heading to the Big Apple. It turns out that Caleb landed a job with a salary big enough to pay for both Hanna's tuition and decent housing for the two of them. (Talk about a fairy tale episode!)</p><p><strong>The Belle of the Ball</strong></p><p>When your psychotic older brother tells you to meet him at prom, most people would probably think twice about attending — unless your name is Alison DiLaurentis (<strong>Sasha Pieterse</strong>). After receiving numerous texts from Charles, Ali — dressed as the Disney princess Belle — went off to see her beast of a brother, unbeknownst to any of her friends. But thanks to the power of social media, the Liars soon realized where she was and headed off to prom (yes, the one they're all not supposed to attend) to try and stop her.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But Charles is always three steps ahead of them and was able to kidnap Ali right under their very noses. Then Ali saw what the rest of us have been waiting six seasons to see — the face behind the infamous black hoodie!</p><p>So who is the man behind all the mystery? We're only one week away from knowing the truth ourselves, folks. Prepare those freak-outs accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Did "Last Dance" sweep you off your feet?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOqamerKSueq21062jnmWcnq6zv4yrnJyZoGKurbXSqKVmoaNiuKqwzZqnqZ2UYryvec%2BrpqZlnp60qcCMa2dqbWRt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
