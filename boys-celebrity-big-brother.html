First up with the fewest votes was Andrew Brady who until recently was a favourite to win the entire series. Unfortunately for Andrew, going up against Ann Widdecombe was not in the public’s favourite and as fascinating he was to watch, we were subjected to a darker side of him and it was perhaps better for him leave as the pressure had got to him."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’ve laughed with him, cried with him and sometimes sneered at his inappropriate jokes and Daniel really showed us his true gentle and vulnerable persona behind his stage facade. He’s everything a Big Brother Housemate and we must add a big congratulation to him and his fiance, whom he proposed to live on air, during his chat with Emma Willis. All together now, awww!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>He's saying goodbye to the <a href=#>#CBB</a> House but <a href=#>@dapperlaughs</a> is still smiling. It's been a great giggle having him ? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nm8RqqkSxl</a></p><p>— Big Brother UK (@bbuk) <a href=#>January 26, 2018</a></p><p>This time next week, the CBB winner will have been crowned!
