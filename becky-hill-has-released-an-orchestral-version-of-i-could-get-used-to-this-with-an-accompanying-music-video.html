The original has been gaining a massive amount of attention, which has certainly been a long time coming for a Becky Hill release as the lead artist. She has previously released some incredible remixes, but this orchestral version is stripped back and magnificent with an awesome music video to accompany it.</p><p>The orchestral performance video took place at RAK Studios according to Becky Hill’s <a href=#>tweet</a>. She also went on to thank the people involved in this version in a follow-up <a href=#>tweet</a>, crediting Jules Buckley for helping her organise this version, Ryan Ashley for the piano and vocal arrangement, Lovelle and Joe Jacquest for backing vocals, Adele Cany for the fashionable jumpsuit that Becky Hill is wearing, and Electric Light Studios for filming the visual.</p><p>Stripped back, this song – which was written by Mark Ralph, Michael Kintish, Rebecca Claire Hill, Ryan Ashley, and Uzoechi Emenike (MNEK) – is even more powerful. The song clearly means a lot to Becky Hill and it’s really resonating with every single person that hears the original; yet, the orchestral version makes a bigger impact with each word driving home how happy love can make us all feel.</p><p>Becky Hill completely shines in the visual as she sings this song with pure emotion. The orchestra allows her to show off her brilliant vocals and raw emotion, allowing us to hear how empowering the song really is. As for the orchestra, themselves, they sound absolutely incredible giving the song an ethereal feeling.</p><h3>Watch Becky Hill’s Video For The Orchestral Version Of “I Could Get Used To This” Here:</h3><p></p><p>“I Could Get Used To This (Orchestra Acoustic)” is available to download and stream right now.
