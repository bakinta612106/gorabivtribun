News Host With Touching Goodbye: Pics</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-18</div><p><a href=#><strong>Giuliana Rancic</strong></a> said goodbye to her E! News hosting duties after 14 years in front of the camera on Monday, Aug. 10. The Giuliana & Bill star and mom-of-one will still be sticking around for Fashion Police, but her farewell to the nightly E! News broadcast was emotional nonetheless.</p><p>“What an honor to work with the most incredible gang in the business,” Rancic, 40, captioned an Instagram photo of the E! News crew on Monday. “I love each and every one of you @enews and thank you for 14 years of love and laughs!!! Thank you for tonight’s beautiful send off. I [love] U! #secondfamily.”</p><p>Rancic got plenty of Instagram shout-outs from her fellow co-anchors on her last day, including<strong> Jason Kennedy</strong>, <strong>Terrence J</strong>, and <strong>Catt Sadler</strong>. She also was surprised with a hilarious blooper reel (oh, how she loves George Clooney!) and was joined by her husband of eight years, <strong>Bill Rancic</strong>.</p><p>“And on this note…it’s a wrap. Fourteen years of memories at one show,” Rancic captioned an Instagram pic hugging her hubby on set. “Fifty more years of memories to be made with my soulmate. Let’s do this @billrancic!!!!!”</p><p>The Celebrity Apprentice alum watched his leading lady take her final bow, but did something even more supportive — he penned a touching love letter titled “Giuliana: Why I’m So Proud.” Bill, 44, gushed about Giuliana’s work ethic and her determination, but also how she overcame breast cancer and infertility issues.</p><p>“Even in recent months, through some of the harder times, you showed nothing but grace under pressure,” he wrote. “You’ve dealt with worse and you’ve taken the high road, when others wouldn’t have, something you always do…That’s something that makes me love and respect you even more.”</p><p>He continued: “I’ll close by saying my wife is the definition of the American Dream. A dream that’s become even more important in recent years. She came to this country at a young age and could barely speak English. All the kids in her class laughed when she stood up at 8 years old and said she wanted to be an award-winning anchor someday. No one is laughing now.”</p><p>Giuliana and her No. 1 supporter then celebrated her huge accomplishment with a big bash. Bill and Kennedy serenaded her and E! Online’s TV editor <strong>Kristin Dos Santos</strong> captured a sweet photo of Giuliana at dinner.</p><p>“Farewell party for @giulianarancic right now,” Santos wrote via Instagram. “So many crazy/fun memories with this girl. You will be missed!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ6irZyerq%2BtjKuYp5uZmHq0tcanqmanlpt6or%2BMnmSnnaeoeqm70q1ksKGknXq1u9Scn6Kml2K0sLvDm7CeZaCesLR5kWlobmlhbQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
