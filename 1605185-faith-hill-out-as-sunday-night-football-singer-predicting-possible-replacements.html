Love all u guys at SNF - I'll b watching!!!</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cindy Boren of the Washington Post</a> reports, Hill has been featured at the start of the Sunday night broadcast for six years now. One of the last vestiges of her rousing performances can be seen below.&nbsp;</p><p>The report also notes that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Gaudelli</a>, executive producer of the NBC&nbsp;broadcast, tweeted a show of appreciation&nbsp;to Hill but made no mention of who will take her spot at the start of the show.</p><p>Thankfully, we have some thoughts on who that might be.</p><p>Hill has the look and voice that resonates with&nbsp;fans. Her replacement will need to be a well-liked performer that can open the broadcast with the perfect blend of power and&nbsp;pizzazz.</p><p>The last thing you want is a polarizing figure who will have half the viewers at home&nbsp;groaning&nbsp;when he or she appears on screen.</p><p>Sounds like an easy endeavor, NBC—let's try not to blow it.</p><p><strong>Carrie Underwood</strong></p><p>If there is any bit of consensus at the moment, it would be for Carrie Underwood to step in and strut her stuff on Sunday night.</p><p>The former American Idol winner has gotten quite the vote of confidence on Twitter, with fans expressing their support for the budding country star to open Sunday Night Football's proceedings.</p>Derek Liberty <span class=acct>@derek_liberty</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Faith Hill isn't doing the Sunday Night Football theme song anymore!? If Carrie Underwood doesn't get this gig, there will be consequences.</p>Scott Carasik <span class=acct>@CarasikS</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Faith Hill not on Sunday Night Football means only one thing... They need to bring in Carrie Underwood to replace her.</p>Swing Coach Show <span class=acct>@SwingCoachShow</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sad day! What is Carrie Underwood doing? RT @JimmyTraina: Faith Hill will no longer be part of NBC's SNF opening: http://t.co/8QAqcL9DEc</p><p>This is really the most obvious solution. Her Super Bowl halftime performance was widely considered a success, despite all you Twitter nitpickers out there.</p><p>She has the look and voice the national stage demands. If there is any star out there who can actually make this her own without worrying about being overshadowed by Hill, it would be Beyonce.</p><p><strong>Pink/Cee Lo Green<br></strong></p><p>From the land of the entirely possible and completely unfortunate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kissing Suzy Kolber</a> mentions two performers we really have to offer as plausible replacements.</p><p>Cee Lo Green sings (screams?) the intro to Thursday Night Football, which cues fans to hit the mute button or take a bathroom break before the game starts.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't forget that Pink&nbsp;performed&nbsp;the initial Sunday Night Football anthem before making way for Faith Hill. Would NBC dare return to the pop singer? I hope not.</p><p>Both performers have experience opening the big game, so they have to be considered as possible solutions to NBC's dilemma. However, they would be met with a resounding "No" from the football-loving population.</p><p><strong>The Voice Cast</strong></p><p>Cross-promotion much?&nbsp;The network very well may look to one of its hit shows for singing talent.</p><p>Whether that would mean a past judge like&nbsp;Christina Aguilera&nbsp;or a current judge like Shakira, nothing is out of the realm of possibility.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>These are our best guesses as to who NBC picks to start the show on Sunday nights. From the lesser-known to the world famous, there are plenty of singers that could replace Hill.</p><p>Did I miss anyone?
