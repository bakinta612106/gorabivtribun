The player cannot negotiate a contract with any other team (local or international). That limbo stays in place for as long as, in this case, the Sixers decide.</p><p>Additionally, new language states that any player who "publicly expresses a desire to be traded to another team shall be subject to a fine [up to $150,000] and/or a suspension."</p><p>While a fine would be small relative to Harden's salary (0.4 percent), a suspension could range from roughly $248,000-$389,000 per day, depending on the length and triggering event (a trade demand is technically cheaper than refusing to play).</p><p>Star players have demanded trades for almost as long as the league has existed. (Look up how Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ended up with the Los Angeles Lakers.) To an extent, there may be no real way to prevent it.</p><p>The rules will prevent Harden from no-showing entirely, but he can make life unpleasant for the franchise, potentially poisoning the well with star center Joel Embiid.</p><p>Harden's goal would be to preserve his Bird rights by forcing a trade to a new team. Still, his leverage may be a willingness to go to free agency next July, provided he doesn't trigger the more extreme punishment by holding out for more than 30 days.</p><p>If that takes down the Sixers' season in the process, so be it.</p><p>Harden has no choice but to show up at some point in Philadelphia, but he may have a "lingering injury<i>"</i> that limits his availability.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGt%2Fdn%2BMbWSrnZGhtrTAyJxkqK2kmLyusdJmnaiqXaq0rcWMo5imnaNitaK%2Bw56lZqiYnrmisMSlp6GhkWKEd7HRrGSsmZeW</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
