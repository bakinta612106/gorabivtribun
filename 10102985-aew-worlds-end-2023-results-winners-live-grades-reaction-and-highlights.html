The first match on the Zero Hour was the bout between Willow and Stat that was just set up on Rampage. They shook hands to show respect before locking up. These are probably the two most powerful women in AEW, so they were evenly matched in many ways.
This was a solid matchup between two of AEW's most beloved babyfaces. The crowd didn't seem to know who to root for at times, but that's the risk you run with bouts like this."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We saw some fun interactions and moments, but this was nothing unexpected. Archer and Killswitch dominated the action and scored the most eliminations. It came down to Trent Beretta and Killswitch at the end, but Christian Cage's protege was able to get the win.</p><p><b>Result: </b>Killswitch defeated 19 other competitors</p><p><b><u>Hook vs. Wheeler Yuta (FTW Championship)</u></b></p><p>The third and final match on the pre-show was for the FTW Championship. This match had no countouts or disqualifications, which was a big change from the Pure Rules matches Yuta has been having recently.</p><p>Yuta tried to jump Hook as soon as he got to the ring, but the FTW champion came in swinging. They put on a decent match that made good use of weapons without making them the only source of offense. Hook retained his title by submission using Red Rum.</p><p><b>Result: </b>Hook defeated Wheeler Yuta</p><p><b>Notable Moments and Observations</b></p><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>Renee Paquette clarified during the pre-show that Kingston's ROH and NJPW openweight titles will not be merged with the new Continental title.
