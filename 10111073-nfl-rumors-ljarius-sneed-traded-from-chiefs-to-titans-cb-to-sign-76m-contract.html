It will be formalized after Sneed passes his physical and it will make him one of the highest-paid CBs in NFL history. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cSPTIZfkhi">https://t.co/cSPTIZfkhi&lt;/a></p><p>The $19 million average annual salary would rank third among cornerbacks behind Jaire Alexander of the Green Bay Packers and Denzel Ward of the Cleveland Browns, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Spotrac</a>.</p><p>The news comes after Kansas City placed the $19.8 million franchise tag on Sneed on Feb. 27. ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeremy Fowler</a> reported that the Chiefs informed Sneed "they are prepared to use the franchise tag and are open to consummate a trade-off it if no long-term deal is reached."</p><p>The Chiefs selected Sneed in the fourth round of the 2020 draft out of Louisiana Tech and he went on to make an immediate impact as a rookie, posting three interceptions, seven passes defended, two sacks and 41 tackles in nine games.</p><p>Sneed put together perhaps the best season of his career in 2022, recording three interceptions, 3.5 sacks, 11 passes defended, three forced fumbles and 108 tackles in 17 games.</p><p>In three playoff games that year, he posted two passes defended and 17 tackles en route to helping the Chiefs win the Super Bowl.</p><p>The 27-year-old is coming off a solid 2023 campaign in which he recorded two interceptions, 14 passes defended, one fumble recovery and 78 tackles in 16 games.</p><p>During the postseason, he posted three pass breakups, one forced fumble and 17 tackles to help the Chiefs become the first team since the New England Patriots to win back-to-back Super Bowls.</p><p>One of the most memorable parts of the playoffs for Sneed came when he forced Zay Flowers to fumble near the goal line in the AFC Championship Game after the Baltimore Ravens wide receiver taunted him in the third quarter.</p><p>Tennessee had to address the cornerback position entering the 2024 season, and the addition of Sneed is exactly what the franchise needed.</p><p>The Titans are getting one solid cornerback in Sneed, who has exceeded his draft status during the early stages of his career. He'll slot into a secondary that includes Kristian Fulton, Chidobe Awuzie and Roger McCreary.</p><p>It's unlikely Tennessee contends for a Super Bowl title next season, but adding Sneed will at least allow it to build for the future.</p><p>As for the Chiefs, Trent McDuffie is the next man up. Joshua Williams could also see more playing time opposite Jaylen Watson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWZ9eH%2BMp52lZaKqurC%2B0majo5minsK0edKnnJ6cXam%2ForDEnWSfqp%2BieqS0yJ6drGWkpHq1tdOapaxlk5d6tbuMrKCgpl1sg655wqilraqRmME%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
