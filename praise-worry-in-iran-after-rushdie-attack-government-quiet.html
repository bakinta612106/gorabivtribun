It is quite remarkably alarming, and we need to be very aware of it, and to fight against it very hard.”</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Rushdie, 75, was blinded in one eye and suffered nerve damage to his hand when he was attacked at a literary festival in New York state in August. His alleged assailant, Hadi Matar, has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and attempted murder.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Rushdie spent years in hiding with police protection after Iran’s Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, in 1989 calling for his death over the alleged blasphemy of the novel “The Satanic Verses.”</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">In his speech, Rushdie also criticized publishers who change decades-old books for modern sensibilities, such as large-scale cuts and rewrites to the works of children’s author Roald Dahl and James Bond creator Ian Fleming.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">He said publishers should allow books “to come to us from their time and be of their time.”</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">“And if that’s difficult to take, don’t read it, read another book,” he said.</p><p>Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.
