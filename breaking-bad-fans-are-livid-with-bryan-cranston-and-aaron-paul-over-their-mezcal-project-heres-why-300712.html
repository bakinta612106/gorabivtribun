News flash it is not the movie sequel, nor does it have anything to do with this hit AMC show.</p><p>The Breaking Bad costars are teaming up to release a Mezcal called Dos Hombres. Paul made the announcement, as well as explained how the project came about via Instagram. He began explaining the two were having dinner discussing how they could work together again, knowing acting together might be out the window for a while.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BlV7POfg7x0/</p><p>“The younger one looked at his drink and said, you know what we should do? We should do a really special Mezcal. The older one said, you mean the liquor with a worm at the bottom? Nah, that was just some bullshit gimmick, I mean real, artesanal Mezcal made by hand in Mexico,” he shared in his message explained how the project came about.</p><p>Paul went on to say he and Cranston even traveled to Oaxaca to find a version “so damn good even people who don’t think they like Mezcal will love it.”</p><p>“We named it Dos Hombres – two guys on a quest. It’s been a long and crazy journey, and we couldn’t be happier to share this with you and the rest of the world,” he shared before ending the message explaining where people could find out more about Dos Hombres.</p><p>Cranston and Paul are thrilled with their new venture, but Breaking Bad fans are fuming mad. They feel cheated and disappointed after weeks of tricks leading them to believe the men were reuniting Walter and Jesse.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BztB46fH4wo/</p><p>“So that was it?! That’s what the hype was about? Nothing related to Breaking Bad?! DISAPPOINTED!” wrote __akash.r__</p><p>“My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined,” replied i.udit</p><p>“So you guys have officially ruined all our hopes,” said abkotharii</p><p>“The biggest troll in the history of trolls. Maybe ever,” stated kaustubh_1202_</p><p>Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston have a new Mezcal company. It has nothing to do with Breaking Bad and fans are not happy with the two men. They certainly fooled fans into thinking the meth mixing duo were back together.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about Cranston and Paul’s announcement?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp7Kit8innmaakZl6p63NrGSaqpViuarCyJ1ksKGknXqjvtiapWabopa7tMDOp2SappRirqK%2BzqdkqZmloXqwwsSrZK2glZ6%2FbrnEs5qapF2lv7C2xJyrZqCVp7K0edahsGZrYGWEcn6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
