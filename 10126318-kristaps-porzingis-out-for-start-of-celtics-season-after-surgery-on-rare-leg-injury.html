The Celtics said Porziņģis will miss five-to-six months, putting him on track to return in November or December.
Porzingis later posted on social media saying that &#34;everything went smooth&#34; with the surgery:

Everything went smooth. Now will take time to heal up and get ready to go again. ☘️☝️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/osDF3jvx6w">https://t.co/osDF3jvx6w&lt;/a></p><p>Porziņģis suffered the injury during Game 2 of the 2024 NBA Finals and missed Game 3 and 4 before returning for the Celtics' clinching victory over the Dallas Mavericks. He had a stellar first season in Boston, averaging 20.1 points, 7.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists while shooting 37.5 percent from three-point range.</p><p>While Porziņģis' absence won't hurt the Celtics' championship pursuit, it could create an awkward situation at the 5 spot next season. Al Horford will be moved back into the starting lineup in Porziņģis' absence after spending much of 2023-24 as a reserve.</p><p>Horford started during Boston's playoff run when Porziņģis missed time with a calf injury as well, and Porziņģis came off the bench during his three Finals appearances. Porziņģis is 28 years old and has been a starter his entire career. It seems unlikely he'd be comfortable transitioning to a full-time reserve role, but conversations may need to be had if Boston gets off to a red-hot start with Horford as a starter.</p><p>Injury issues have plagued Porziņģis throughout his NBA career. He's never played more than 72 games in a season and has missed at least 15 games in eight straight seasons overall. Next season will almost certainly mark a ninth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuAcoSMpKmiq6SWvbR5z6ips6GenLa0ec6uq2aen6d6tMDAq6tmp5ZisKa406KarGWjmq60u81mmJ%2Bslad6tMHRoJyrsV2ku26%2BwKucZqSVnHqqusmuqbI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
