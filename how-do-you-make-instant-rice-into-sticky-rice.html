By letting rice soak for 30 minutes or so, you can reduce the cooking time of most rice varieties by about 20 percent. Soaking rice can also affect the flavor of the finished dish.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happens_if_you_soak_rice_before_cooking></span>What happens if you soak rice before cooking?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Soaking rice prior to cooking usually 30 minutes is sufficient and provides a few benefits: First, it shortens cooking time as the grains absorb water. Soaking hydrates the grains and consequently, the amylose and amylopectin inside the starch granules absorb water and swell.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_cold_soak_Minute_Rice></span>How do you cold soak Minute Rice?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pour rice into a cold soak jar.
