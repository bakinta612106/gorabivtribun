Now, there's no doubt that they're together. On June 28, Jack posted a photo of himself and Jay kissing in front of a stadium, which Jay reposted to her own Instagram Story.

In a 2019 interview with Sports Illustrated, Jack explained that an announcer gave him <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>the nickname Jungle Boy</a> when he was using the alias Nate Coy.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"At first, I hated it," Jack said. "I thought, 'What did he just stick me with?' Then I started to develop the character around the name, and I love it now. It's completely my own. Eventually, I dropped the Nate Coy, and now I am Jungle Boy." In character as Jungle Boy, Jack keeps his long hair loose and wears leopard print shorts.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See The Rock's 19-Year-Old Daughter, Who's Climbing Up the WWE Ranks</a>.</strong></p><p>Jay is also signed with All Elite Wrestling and is a member of the group The Dark Order. However, she's currently taking some time off from wrestling after suffering a shoulder injury earlier this year. She and Jack haven't shared much about their relationship yet other than the photo he posted and some <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>kissy-face emoji in the comments section</a> of a previous post. Their wrestling friends are definitely exciting about the pairing, though. Jack's post was met with plenty of "finally!" messages and one that reads, "There we goooooooo."</p><p><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p>In an Instagram post following Luke's death in March 2019, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Jack wrote</a>, "He was a lot of things to a lot of people. To me, he was always Dad. He loved and supported me in everything, and inspired me to be the best that I could possibly be." He added, "I'll do whatever I can to carry on your legacy and make you proud."</p><p>In the Sports Illustrated interview, Jack shared that he doesn't want to find success through who his father was. "My family is a part of who I am, but I'm trying to make my own way," he explained. "I don't want to use that to be successful, I want to have my own success."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/luke-perry-1.jpg><p>Before Jack was signed to a big wrestling organization, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Luke was spotted</a> at one of his son's early matches in 2017. In a video from the event, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Luke can be seen</a> on the bleachers with the rest of the small crowd, filming the match on his phone. At one point he stands up, nervously watching the fight.</p><p>Jack is 24 years old and has a 21-year-old sister named<strong> Sophie Perry</strong>. Their mother is<strong> Rachel Sharp</strong>, who was married to Luke from 1993 to 2003.</p><p>The siblings are close.
