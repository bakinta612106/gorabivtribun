Becoming a mother has given her a well of strength that sometimes shocks her, even. She is so in love with her daughter. True’s everything to her and gives her so much joy and a feeling of fulfillment. True makes Khloe feel like she can do anything.’</p><p>All Khloe wants is to let all of that in the past and focus on being strong and a good role model for her daughter as she grows up.</p><p>‘Khloe is very clear that she is a strong woman standing on her own two feet. That is the energy she wants to show her daughter and that’s what she’s striving for. That isn’t to say she does not want to meet someone again one day but for now there is no manhunt, her focus is on being True’s mommy and on her very busy career, right now that is enough for her.’</p><p>That is great to hear, especially since Tristan’s scandal with Jordyn Woods is just now being discussed on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Reliving the drama could have really affected Khloe but she previously revealed that she hadn’t watched the episodes since she knows all too well it’s not healthy.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebqsSsecqho6idXaCus7DArJ%2BimZ5isq6706Kmp5mcocZuv9Orpqeflad6tbTAp2SerpWnerC6y7JkpqeeqbW0ecCfq56qXam1pnnSqaOirF2bv7C5jK2poquklrtuwMeopKmrn6N6c4WWbG5qZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
