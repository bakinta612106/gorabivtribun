At approximately 10:30 p.m., the peace was disrupted as law enforcement rushed to the scene on Foxtrail Drive in response to a distressing report of gunshots. As officers sped toward the 700 block of Foxtrail Drive, the gravity of the situation escalated with information relayed that a shooting had occurred and a victim was potentially in need of urgent assistance. The urgency intensified as reports revealed the severe nature of the situation: the back door of a residence had been riddled with bullets, the interior bore the scars of the terrifying onslaught, and telltale signs in the form of shell casings punctuated the harrowing scene.</p><p>Upon arrival, law enforcement was met with a distressing sight a shattered sense of security and a victim, a 39-year-old male, bearing the painful consequence of a gunshot wound to his left ankle/foot region. Despite the chaos that ensued, the victim’s injuries, fortunately, were assessed as non-life-threatening. Swiftly, he was transported to TidalHealth in Salisbury, where medical professionals attended to his wounds.</p><p>The details that emerged painted a grim picture: two suspects, their identities concealed by attire of all black and masks obscuring their faces, had initiated this senseless violence.
