up, I’ma hold my ground<br>I’ve had enough, now I’m so fed up<br>Time to put my life back together right now (now)</p><p>It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me<br>Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you<br>So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through<br>And don’t realize what you did, (’cause) believe me you<br>I been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger<br>I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of<br>My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead<br>No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on<br>I promise to focus solely on handlin’ my responsibilities as a father<br>So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it<br>You couldn’t lift a single shingle on it, ’cause the way I feel<br>I’m strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub<br>And lift the whole liquor counter up ’cause I’m raising the bar<br>I’d shoot for the moon but I’m too busy gazin’
