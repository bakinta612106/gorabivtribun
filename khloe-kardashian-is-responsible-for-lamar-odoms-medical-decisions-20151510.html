A source confirms to <strong>Us</strong> that "any medical decisions are up to Khloe" while the divorce documents are still pending.</p><p>Though the exes <a href=#>signed off on the papers together</a> this past July, a judge has yet to finalize the divorce. Meanwhile, Kardashian arrived at the Sunrise Hospital in Vegas from L.A. this past Tuesday, immediately after learning about Odom's condition, <a href=#>and hasn't left his side</a>.

"She will be there hoping he pulls through, but I hear the situation is not very good."</p><p>Joining the Kardashians are Odom's ex, <strong>Liza Morales</strong>, and their two kids,<strong> Destiny</strong> and<strong> Lamar Jr.</strong>, for whom Khloe <a href=#>made travel arrangements</a>.</p><p>Watch the video above to look back on Khloe and Lamar's relationship. &nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Khloe personally flew in Lamar’s dad and his kids," an insider told <strong>Us.</strong> "So that they could be with him during this difficult time."</p><p>The sheriff's office confirmed in a presser on Wednesday that Odom had used cocaine on Saturday.

"Oh my god, I miss him every day," Kardashian told Complex in its August/September 2015 issue. "I miss what we had—things we got to do together are just memories. I like looking back and holding on to that stuff. I definitely miss it, and there’s times I’ll get so sentimental and so sad, but this had to happen for some reason."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKhpJ%2Baeqyt0Z2YrKCZlrtutdJmqZ6roKS7tLXBpZxmnp%2Bneq2tzJqpZqeUpLq0ecyem6KbkaF6pbHCoqqip56oenN8kG5obmlg</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
