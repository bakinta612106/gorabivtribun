However, he neither has children. He seems to be waiting for his perfect match.</p><h2><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span></h2><p>Previously, he was once about to be banned from Roblox. KonekoKitten has got some resentment due to Cyrillic and special usernames being reset shortly after a video about the subject on his channel. Due to this, he performed a video about the reset asserting that it was a coincidence that the usernames were reset around the same time he posted the original video about special usernames.</p><p>One user-watched his video and announced the Cyrillic usernames to the Roblox team, likely through roblox.com/support or <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=a0c9cec6cfe0d2cfc2cccfd88ec3cfcd>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>, which terminated resetting maël4000, Vexillogic, and any future Cyrillic username, or that a Roblox staff member saw the video and reset the usernames themselves. A lot of other usernames also pretended as a result of the video.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_and_Social_Media>Body Measurements and Social Media</span></h2><p>Details about KonekoKitten’s body measurements like height, weight, chest-waist-hip measurement, etc are not available.
