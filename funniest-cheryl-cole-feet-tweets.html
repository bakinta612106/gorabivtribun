In 2011, Cole revealed that she has a serious shot fetish and shared that her size three feet can walk and dance in heels of any height. In the summer of 2014, Cheryl Cole’s feet found their way into the spotlight again when pictures of Cole began to surface in which her feet looked non-existent. &nbsp;After appearing in&nbsp;The X Factor’s 2014 promotional photos wearing a pants/shoe combination that made her feet blend in with the rest of her clothes, viewers and fans began to speculate why Cole would want to hide&nbsp;her feet. Shortly after, a possible answer began to circulate. During an interview, when Cheryl Cole revealed that her feet stink, the internet went crazy discussing the digesting comment. &nbsp;Since then Twitter users have continued to talk about Cheryl Cole’s feet and their posts seem to cover a wide range of emotions. &nbsp;Here are three of the funniest Cheryl Cole feet tweets.</p><h2>3.</h2><p><a href=#>https://twitter.com/angwypantsx/status/551748133538242561</a></p><p>Nobody likes stinky feet, and that’s something Cheryl Cole probably should have considered before openly admitting that her feet stink. &nbsp;After her announcement, several listeners found themselves disgusted with Cole and her sweaty feet.</p><h2>2.</h2><p><a href=#>https://twitter.com/SkyCC_GA/status/324213603265806337</a></p><p>Cheryl Cole’s feet seem to have disappeared in this picture as the bottom of her jeans directly meet the floor. Although she is usually pretty trendy, and takes pride in her immense shoe collection, she seems to have completely missed the ball with this outfit.</p><h2>1.</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fat, ugly, thick wolves fan posting joke about ugly, inbred baggies. Now I'm no Cheryl Cole but at least I can see my feet & spell my name</p><p>— Sallyann (@Sal_Wba) <a href=#>February 5, 2013</a></p><p>Due to several strange shoe choices, Cheryl Cole’s feet have often been difficult to spot as they’ve completely blended in with the rest of her outfit. &nbsp;Although it’s a little unclear what exactly this Twitter is referring to in the beginning of her tweet; however, it’s clear that she takes a great deal of pride in being able to see her feet.</p><p>(Photo by Andreas Rentz/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidrqaenrK0wIycn56qqaF6pLvLnmSfnZWperXDxJ6rrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
