No, they don’t have any announcements to make just yet, but that doesn’t mean that the Maroon 5 singer doesn’t have babies on the brain already. The 35-year-old singer and coach on The Voice says he’s eager to start a family, and that he’s looking forward to doing so with his new wife.</p><p>“I want to have 100 kids. I want to have more kids than is socially responsible. We can’t do it right now, but it’s in the works,” he says of his desire to have kids with his new wife. So while he’s looking forward to tiny little supermodel babies running around his household, the world is going to have to wait to see those perfect little specimens. At the moment, he and his 25-year-old wife are in the midst of doing something else in their relationship.</p><p>Prinsloo is starring in Maroon 5’s new music video alongside her husband. The singer posted a photo to his Instagram account yesterday that shows what the new couple is up to. Standing together, the supermodel is doing her thing in her husband’s new video. The photo was posted along with “#ANIMALS,” which just so happens to be the name of one of the songs on the band’s new album, and its second single.</p><p>“V” is the name of the new album, and it’s going to be a good one if the Levine’s Instagram photo says anything at all about it. With his new wife beside him, the video is sure to be a hit. The couple didn’t even make their first public appearance together following their wedding until late August when they attended the MTV VMA’s together.</p><p>(Photo by Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiYnZmdYrmmwsinnGavkaPBtHnTqGShmaaaeqJ51Z6psmWclr%2BosYyfmKahnK58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
