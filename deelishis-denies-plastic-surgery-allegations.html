As previously reported the “Flavor Of Love” alum sparked sorcery chatter after she shared a video of herself posing and making kissy faces at a camera.
People pointed out that Deelishis looks A LOT different from her VH1 days and alleged that she “had to have had” plastic surgery. One even pointed out that the reality star might have gone under the knife after being body-shamed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Just because a person knows all of your business doesn’t mean they’re your BEST FRIEND… they might just be your toxic well informed by you friend…”</p><h3>Deelishis Denies Plastic Surgery</h3><p>Deelishis has denied the surgery allegations via a video post.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2123414 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2022/03/16462296443442.jpg alt="2017 BET Awards - Backstage" width=682 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-2123414 class=wp-caption-text>Source: Johnny Nunez / Getty</p><p>According to Deelishis, she’s never had a nose job and people “look stupid” debating about it.</p><p>“Because I’m probably one of the funniest, goofiest, silliest people I know I’ll take a moment to entertain the idiots in the back again ?… but honestly who cares ??‍♀️ (apparently I do for mentioning it???‍♀️) still who cares!!” Deelishis captioned a makeup-free video of herself. “I French inhale Mary Jane through it, I definitely store mucus and buggers in it, oh and I use it to SMELL!! Like I really don’t know why people examine other peoples mucus hole ( ??) so much anyway ? My nose does NO bodily function for you, neither does it give or take your life… so there I’ll say it again… my nose should be as a worthless piece of flesh to you bringing you no perks nor value therefore YOU look stupid debating about it! Next!!!”</p><p>In the video Deelishis added,</p><p>“Deelishis—where’s your nose job? I did not do my makeup yet. When I do my makeup my nose is gonna be—snatched.”</p><p>Oop!</p><p>What do YOU think about Deelishis denying having plastic surgery?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnZyepJmotaq%2FjJ2cp6GVqHqxuMCsq6KbXajCs7PEq7BmmZyhsqit06Kmp6tf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
