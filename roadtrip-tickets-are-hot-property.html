Within minutes of the shows’ tickets going on sale to the public on January 23rd, vending websites were inundated with Roadies trying to seize the chance of catching the band live.</p><p>The charismatic five-piece have won over fans’ hearts with their active social media presence, light-hearted YouTube vlogs, original band covers of hit pop tracks and their own original work. Many fans saw the chance to have a Meet & Greet with the band as an opportunity too good to pass out, with tickets for that experience selling out at a number of venues.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Full update on <a href=#>@RoadTripTV</a> tickets (as of 8:45pm)</p><p>Manchester: Standard only<br>Glasgow: 3x M&G & standard only<br>Dublin: Standard only<br>Birmingham: SOLD OUT<br>London: 1x M&G & standard only<br>Sheffield: 4x standard only<br>Newcastle: 4x M&G & standard only <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tWtwwx1yYH</a></p>— ALSTAR MUSIC (@alstarmusic) <a href=#>January 23, 2019</a></figure><p>Tour organisers, ALSTAR MUSIC, reported on Twitter that the Birmingham O2 Academy show had sold out, whilst a handful of standard tickets remained at Manchester’s Club Academy, Dublin’s Academy and Sheffield’s Corporation. At other dates, only single figure’s worth of Meet & Greet tickets remained, as well as standard entry, at 20:15 on Wednesday.</p><p>However, Roadies shouldn’t be worried yet! Andy took to TikTok later on in the evening to talk about the overwhelmingly positive response to the shows and announced that further batches of tickets would be available, as well as the possibility of more dates if those sell out again. One fan account, @<a href=#>roadtripgains</a>, shared the videos:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/roadtripgains/status/1088192736778428416</p></figure><p>The band last toured the U.K. only last October, stopping off at many of the same cities as this time around, as fans can’t seem to get enough. With an ever-growing fan-base across the continent thanks to a support slot for close friend HRVY and their social media presence. Flagship single, ‘Take This Home’, was also released in 2018 with a music video on New Year’s Eve.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Were you lucky enough to get tickets for RoadTrip’s U.K. tour?
