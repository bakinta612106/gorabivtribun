That is when he thought it would be fitting to call out the two YouTubers.
The speech was also an opportunity to promote The Masked Singer’s second season since he is one of the panelists."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Ken was accepting the award for Choice Comedy Movie in the name of the Crazy Rich Asians cast members.</p><p>That is when he thought it would be fitting to call out the two YouTubers.</p><p>The speech was also an opportunity to promote The Masked Singer’s second season since he is one of the panelists.</p><p>As he was joined on stage by two people wearing the pineapple and the monster costumes from he first season, the comedian said: ‘I’m so excited for the second season of The Masked Singer. It is bigger and better than ever. In fact, I am so hyped for you guys, for you kids, I’m going to give you a sneak preview and reveal one of the celebrities who will be under one of the masks!’</p><p>Of course, it was all a joke. Pretending someone backstage reminded him that revealing such information would violate his non-disclosure agreement and might get him sued for millions of dollars, he added: ‘It’s best to wait.’</p><p>‘Besides, Jake Paul over here would be pissed,’ Ken said, pointing to the person in the pineapple costume. ‘And that could stress out his pretend marriage and lead to a fake divorce from his not-wife. Am I right, kids?’</p><p>His relevant joke definitely took people by surprise since some kids in the audience looked shocked.</p><p>Jeong was, of course, referring to the controversial marriage between Jake Paul and Tana Mongeau which is generally regarded as fake and only for clout.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Later on, Tana actually reacted to the shade with a tweet that reads: ‘NO WAY DID THE TEEN CHOICE AWARDS JUST SHADE JAKE AND I NO WAY!? FROM WANTING TO BE NOMINATED SO BAD TO FINDING OUT IT WAS RIGGED TO THIS. WOW. MY EVOLUTION. someone show me the clip omg.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmrtutsSopaBlmJ65or7IqKyspKliwKmtw56qZqKRoLJuvMCuo2aZnpl6ta3NmmSmp56csqLB0madmqOVYrqivtGimKCdXZbBbsDHnmStnZWjeqS0zqKanmWRrK6zsNJmmKecXamur62Mq5ysqJ%2BjsbR5kmpncG5pZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
