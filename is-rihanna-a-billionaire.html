Has all of this success and wealth made Rihanna a billionaire?</p><p><strong>No, Rihanna is not a billionaire. Between her career as a performing artist and her venture with her new cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty, Rihanna is a multimillionaire. As of 2019, her net worth was sitting at $600 million. She is also listed as the world’s richest female musician.</strong></p><p>You can read more about Rihanna’s financial success and earning the title of wealthiest female musician below.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rihanna’s Music Industry Success</h2><p>Having been a professional musician for over fifteen years now, Rihanna has had quite the career. She has recorded a total of eight studio albums. Her first album ever released was <a href=# rel=noopener>Music of the Sun</a> in 2005. The album went gold in five countries and platinum in Canada. A successful beginning for any new artist.&nbsp;</p><p>Her second studio album, <a href=# rel=noopener>A Girl Like Me</a>, made an even bigger splash going platinum in seven different countries. This album featured the songs SOS and Unfaithful. But it wasn’t until Rihanna dropped her third album in as many years that she started to see huge success. <a href=# rel=noopener>Good Girl Gone Bad</a> went six times platinum in the United States. At the 2008 Grammys, Rihanna was nominated for four awards and won the award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for her song Umbrella.</p><p>Rihanna has released another five albums that have all hit the multi-platinum level in multiple countries. This fact has led to her selling over <a href=# rel=noopener>60 million albums</a> and 215 million digital tracks. In 2017, before launching her company Fenty, Rihanna had a <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of approximately $230 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Success in Launching Fenty</h2><p>It was in September of 2017 that Rihanna launched her company <a href=# rel=noopener>Fenty Beauty</a>. It was the first time Rihanna had created a venture of her own, having previously worked in collaboration with companies like MAC Cosmetics.&nbsp;</p><p>Rihanna made a deal in 2016 with the luxury product company&nbsp; <a href=# rel=noopener>Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey</a> (LVHM) for them to manufacture her products. LVHM has deals with the beauty companies Kat Von D and Marc Jacobs. It is also owned by the third richest man in the world, billionaire <a href=# rel=noopener>Bernard Arnault</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After launching the Fenty Beauty products for sale at Sephora, Rihanna’s <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth skyrocketed</a> to a total of $600 million. This made her the richest female musician in the world, surpassing Madonna who has a net worth of $570 million. This also made her the richest person from Barbados.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Does Riri Spend Her Money On?</h2><p>With $600 million in the bank, where exactly does Rihanna spend her hard earned cash. While some of the ultra-wealthy are known for living modestly, Rihanna is not one of them. She has previously rented a private island. Her <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles mansion</a> is valued at $7.5 million and she has been trying to rent the place out for $35,000 a month. She also has a <a href=# rel=noopener>car collection worth</a> a reported $8 million. Riri’s <a href=# rel=noopener>hair extensions</a>? Well those reportedly cost her $1 million a year!&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011, Rihanna spent $300,000 a week on a <a href=# rel=noopener>private yacht vacation</a>. The chartered yacht took the Disturbia singer through the French Riviera. She also has a home at the prestigious <a href=# rel=noopener>One Sandy Lane in Barbados</a>. Sandy Lane is where all the high profile visitors, from Prince Harry to Jennifer Anniston, stay while in Barbados.</p><p>These are fairly extravagant purchases, but most of Rihanna’s spending seems to be allocated to other people. Her personal trainer, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jaimie Granger</a>, costs the singer $1500 a day. Rih’s private chef is <a href=# rel=noopener>Debbie Soloman</a>, and she pays the chef $800 a day to make her meals. Oh, and the <a href=# rel=noopener>stylist</a> who takes care of Rihanna’s ever changing hairstyles, Ursula Stephen, makes $1000 a day.</p><p>You can watch the below YouTube video from TheTalko to learn more about how Rihanna spends all of her dough.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZqqZna6vusBmmGaamaG5qrvNmqCrnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
