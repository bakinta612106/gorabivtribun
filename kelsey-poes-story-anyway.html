The woman vying to be married to the farmer Bachelor from Iowa. The woman who made a complete fool of herself on national television and continues to do so in the press any chance she gets. We just adore the fact that she seems completely and utterly unfazed by the fact that she’s a laughingstock; it makes us happy. In case you are not watching this season of The Bachelor (shame on you), you might not be overly familiar with this fabulous, fabulous storyline. And we don’t say that to be rude or crass, we say that because Kelsey Poe herself has made it impossible to feel otherwise. A woman who sound garner sympathy and love from the general public because of her sad and horrific history has managed to create nothing but hatred and shock, and we’re just not sure what to think.</p><p>A widow, Poe was married to a man who &nbsp;died very unexpectedly as he walked to work back in 2013. He apparently just did not make it after collapsing on his walk, and she was devastated. Well, she was devastated until she realized her story would garner sympathy from fans on this reality show less than two years after his death. In one of her episodes with the Bachelor, she sits down and happily recaps telling her story to the man whose heart she is trying to win, telling the cameras that her story is so amazing. It really turned people off hearing her talk about how amazing her story is, considering the fact that she is speaking of her late husband.</p><p>Now that she’s not going to be the next Mrs. Farmer from Iowa, <a href=#>Kelsey Poe</a> has made the decision to head to Paris to become a writer. Her blog has taken off a bit and there is only one place a writer can be truly successful; Paris. I guess that makes the rest of us successful writers fairly unsuccessful.</p><p>Photo by ABC</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiinqSjmsZuvM6eqmarpKS%2FunnAp7Cwmalk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
