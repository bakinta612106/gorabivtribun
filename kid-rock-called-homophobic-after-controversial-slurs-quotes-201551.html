In the piece, he discusses the things that he "knows" such as the fact that he's&nbsp;"not just wealthy" but "loaded," doesn't "smoke much weed," and became successful with women after selling 14 million records.&nbsp;</p><p>After noting that he is "not as educated as some politicians" schoolbook-wise and saying that he is "an old guy now," Kid Rock wrote about his music career while invoking a slur in a section about rap-rock.</p><p>"Rap-rock was what people wanted at the time, and they still love those songs at shows," he said. "But it turned into a lot of bulls–t and it turned out to be pretty gay… If someone says you can't say 'gay' like that you tell them to go f–k themselves. You're not going to get anything politically correct out of me."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He went on to offer his thoughts on gay marriage in a bullet point beginning "I am definitely a Republican." "As an ordained minister I don't look forward to marrying gay people," the rocker added. "But I'm not opposed to it."</p><p>After the article made its way online, readers reacted on Twitter, calling the star <a href=#>"homophobic"</a> and <a href=#>"trash."</a> Kid Rock has yet to comment on the backlash.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKinF2nvKS3jJyYpaSVmXqpu8yop6Gnkp6wbq3FrZyrZZOku7W%2Bzq%2Bcq6uZlrluv8uuqaxloaq8tbHSZmlpaWVqfg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
