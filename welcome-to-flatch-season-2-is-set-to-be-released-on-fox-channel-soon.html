Season 2 episode 1 of Welcome to Flatch will premiere on FOX on Thursday, September 29 at 9 p.m. ET.&nbsp;The Fox comedy is undeniably popular, and it is projected to establish itself as one of the network‚Äôs top comedies. The popularity of the first season led to the series being renewed for a second season. The first episode of Welcome to Flatch aired in March 2022. The comedy series was shot in a documentary format, with a film crew going about the imaginary little town of Flatch in Ohio, documenting the town‚Äôs and its citizens‚Äô activities. Flatch is full of interesting and eccentric characters, such as Kelly Mallett and her cousin and closest friend, Shrub Mallet. They are, of course, the series‚Äô protagonists.</p><h2>Season 2 of Welcome to Flatch</h2><p>Season 1 of the mockumentary-style comedy laid the groundwork for the tale and the townfolk by delving into each character and identifying their quirks. The local annual Scarecrow Festival, in which Kelly and Shrub participated, was a season 1 highlight. The two cousins, his girlfriend Cheryl, the famous editor of the local newspaper The Flatch Patriot, and others were handed to the local pastor, Father Joe.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Welcome-to-Flatch-1.jpg alt="Welcome to Flatch" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The season concluded with the fourteenth episode, Merry Flatchmas, which was set around the town‚Äôs Christmas festival. The highlight of the conclusion was Kelly putting her father in charge of the celebrations, and things went horribly wrong.&nbsp;The second season picks up where the previous one left off. So we‚Äôll have to wait and watch what happens after the Christmas calamity. Unfortunately, no trailer for season 2 has been released. When the new season starts, it seems that we will be going deep into Flatch. Season 2 has just three episodes confirmed thus far. Welcome to (Barb) Flatch is the title of Episode 1.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The people are definitely ready to flock to Barb. üòâüëè <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#WelcomeToFlatch</a> is back this Thursday at 9/8c on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@FOXTV</a>! ü•≥ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/A8rhTItLDc</a></p><p>‚Äî Welcome To Flatch (@WelcomeToFlatch) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 24, 2022</a></p><h2>Members of the cast are anticipated to return.</h2><ul><li>Kelly Mallet is played by Chelsea Holmes.</li><li>Lloyd ‚ÄúShrub‚Äù Straley (Sam Straley) Mallet</li><li>Mickey St. is played by Justin Linville.
