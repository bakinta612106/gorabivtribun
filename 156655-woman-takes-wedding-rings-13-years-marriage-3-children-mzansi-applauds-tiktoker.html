"<p class=align-left>Holburn said many relationship problems happen because people have different ideas of what love is.</p>"One partner will say - you don’t show love to me. The other will say - but I do this and this for you. For the one person doing x means they are showing love. For the other partner it is not showing love. Two people can say love is important in a relationship. But each may have a very different idea of what demonstrating love is. "Knowing the love language of your partner is a very good way of knowing how your efforts to show love will be seen as love," Holburn added.<h2>Mzansi applauds the woman and shares their heartwarming divorce stories</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> user is not the only one going through marital problems.
