In the book, that was written in 2008, Sylvia spoke about a pneumonia-like illness that would plague the entire globe in 2020. Kim shared a photo on her Instagram stories that quoted a passage from Sylvia Browne’s book that eerily predicted what many believe is the Coronavirus.</p><p>The passage from Sylvia Browne’s book comes after Kim called the doctor after Khloe Kardashian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began coughing</a>, as reported by Nick Markus.</p><p>Sylvia Browne wrote the following in her book.</p><p>“In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.”</p><p>You may see the photo that Kim Kardashian shared on her official Instagram story below.</p><p><img decoding=async alt width=750 height=1333 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89830920_2606006436351919_1887894256966696960_n-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>It is unlikely that Khloe Kardashian has Coronavirus as the main symptom is a fever — and not a cough or sore throat. In fact, a fever is what separates the symptoms of Coronavirus from seasonal allergies that may also produce a cough or sore throat.</p><p>Keep in mind that the majority of people who contract Coronavirus will fight it off on their own, with their immune system. The main issues is that for those with underlying health issues or the elderly, their immune systems may not be able to fight off the Coronavirus. As the virus replicates, it will infect the lungs and move on to other organs and can result in death.</p><p>At this point, the only celebrities to announce they have tested positive for the Coronavirus are Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about the passage from Sylvia Browne’s book that Kim Kardashian shared with her 162 million Instagram followers? Do you think that the late psychic, Sylvia Browne accurately predicted the Coronavirus pandemic in her book End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies about the End of the World?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebnrput8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nSoZirnaNivaK%2F0pqenmWWp7yuec%2BssJygmZh6tMXLoq2aZZKnvLi6xKxkm6efoHqltcNmqqGdXaW%2FprDInKtmm5%2BnvK%2Bt1aKprqtdpa6vsMSmoJxlY2yEeYSXaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
