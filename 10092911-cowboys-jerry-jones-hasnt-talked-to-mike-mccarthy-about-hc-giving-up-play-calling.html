During an appearance on 105.3 The Fan (h/t Jon Machota of The Athletic), Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said &#34;no, in any way,&#34; when asked if he had considered or talked to the head coach about giving offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer play-calling responsibilities.
While Dallas is 3-2 overall, Sunday's loss was the second in its last three games."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It also fell in surprising fashion to an Arizona Cardinals team playing without quarterback Kyler Murray in Week 3.</p><p>The team struggled in every facet in the blowout defeat to the 49ers. The defense allowed four passing touchdowns to Brock Purdy, while the offense couldn't get anything going on the ground or through the air.</p><p>Dallas ran for 57 yards on three yards per carry, while quarterback Dak Prescott went just 14-of-24 for 153 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions.</p><p>The Cowboys are a middling 17th in the league in yards per game (327.4) and have struggled to establish much offensive consistency in the early portion of the season.</p><p>A change may eventually be in order, but Jones doesn't want to make it ahead of Dallas' <i>Monday Night Football </i>showdown with the Los Angeles Chargers. Yet more offensive struggles would put Prescott and McCarthy under a bigger microscope given the national audience that will be tuning in for the Monday night game.</p><p>The Cowboys will also enter their bye week after the game against Los Angeles, which might be an ideal time to make a switch if one was eventually in the cards.</p><p>For now, though, McCarthy will continue calling plays as Dallas looks to bounce back from an ugly showing against the 49ers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWeGcn2MnKawmp%2BuwG62xKupsmWapLumv4yhmKympGLBorjKnptmrJ9iuqq3xGaknJuRp8GpxYyamaitpGK1pHnGoq2ippdiwrF5z6WYsmWTlrmttc2g</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
