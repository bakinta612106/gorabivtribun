Shortly after news broke that the longtime co-host would be replaced on the ABC show by former contestant <a href=#><strong>Erin Andrews</strong></a>, Burke-Charvet took to Twitter to joke about her surprising exit. S<a href=#>ee the latest pics of Brooke here</a>.</p><p>"So much chatter bout DWTS. I'm really cool, everyone," the 42-year-old <a href=#>tweeted</a> on Sunday, Feb. 23. "I did my 7 seasons, had a blast! I'm ready for change. I love your loyalty. Thank you!"</p><p>A little while later, she added: "Here's the skinny — the show found out Harold Wheeler, the band, Rob & me were putting together our own road show, so they fired us all!" (As <a href=#>previously reported</a>, music director Wheeler and his 28-member live backing band were also fired earlier this month.)</p><p>"Off to bed with my sense of humor. I was totally kidding, Tweeties," the model clarified. "Night nite! Sweet dreams."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Burke-Charvet first joined DWTS as a competitor during season 7 in 2008. After taking home the Mirrorball trophy with partner <a href=#><strong>Derek Hough</strong></a>, she went on to join <strong>Tom Bergeron</strong> as co-host in season 10 — the same season in which her replacement, Fox Sports reporter Andrews, debuted as a contestant. (A source confirmed to <strong>Us</strong> on Feb. 23 that Andrews would take over in season 18.)</p><p>"It is nothing personal against Brooke," a source tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> of Burke-Charvet's firing. "Everyone loved her." The insider adds, however, that the longtime co-host was "totally blindsided."</p><p>Executive producer Conrad Green, for his part, told <strong>Us</strong>, "[Brooke has] been a wonderful part of the Dancing With the Stars family since her triumphant win in season 7 and will unquestionably be missed by our entire team. We'd like to thank Brooke for her years of great service."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOm6mop5uaeqPB0aScZpuYlr%2B3sdNmoaijlah6oq7OrqtmnJGjsKq6xmauoqyYYsGpsYysq5qqo2KyubXTZquhnalis6q%2BxJ1krqtdlrmteZFpaG1qZGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
