Fan favorites were heavily nominated this year. Orange is the New Black comes in with 12 Emmy nods and Game of Thrones received 19 Emmy nods. However, The Good Wife was completely left off the list of Emmy nominated televisions shows. Critics believe that the just wrapped season of the show is the best one yet, and can’t believe that the show did not receive a nomination in the best drama category. Other surprising snubs include The Americans and The Blacklist, shows that are both new and were both expected to see some love at the Emmy’s.</p><p>As far as actors are concerned, many thought that The Blacklist’s James Spader, Masters of Sex’s Michael Sheen and Ray Donovan’s Live Schreiber would receive nominations, and did not. Merritt Wever won last year for best supporting actress for her role in Nurse Jackie, but she was not nominated again this year, and neither was Bellamy Young from the hit series, Scandal.</p><p>Announcing the nominations Thursday morning was Mindy Kaling, who was not nominated for The Mindy Project. Additionally, some surprise snubs in the comedy series include Modern Family’s Ed O’Neill, Community’s Joel McHale, and Modern Family’s Sofia Vergara, who has received four Emmy nominations for her role on the hit comedy in the past.</p><p>On a happy note, however, some seriously great nominations were also made to balance out the ones that were clearly ignored. Allison Janney received nominations for Mom and Masters of Sex. Taylor Schilling was nominated for the first time ever in the comedy sector for her role in Orange is the New Black and Benedict Cumberbatch was nominated for his role in Sherlock: This Last Vow. To see who takes home the win this year, tune in to NBC for the 66th annual Emmy Awards on August 25.</p><p>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGimr52iobywt8SdZJ6lna56r7vMoqWarJmku7R52J6Yq2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
