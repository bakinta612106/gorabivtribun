Nicole Arbour is defending her controversial “Dear Fat People” video, which reportedly led to her losing a movie role. The Canadian YouTube star laughed off the ongoing backlash during an interview with BBC on Friday, Sept. 11.
“My aim was to make people laugh. I think that’s pretty darn noble,” Arbour, 28, said. “Whenever I do a video, there’s always comedy mixed with some satire, some stinging truths, and a resolution at the end."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I think that’s pretty darn noble,” Arbour, 28, said. “Whenever I do a video, there’s always comedy mixed with some satire, some stinging truths, and a resolution at the end.”</p><p>She added: “I don’t shame people. It was an act. It was one bit and I do a new bit every single week. I don’t hate anyone. I don’t shame anyone. I don’t actually believe in bullying at all.”</p><p>During the interview, Arbour also shrugged off her critics, saying she didn’t understand why overweight people would be upset by the clip.</p><p>“The video was about obese people. I was very specific that it’s not the average guy with some cushion for the pushin’. [The message is that] we really care about them and we want them to be healthy because I’m selfish and I want them to be around,” she told BBC. “I don’t think it’s a cheap laugh. Twenty million views isn’t that cheap. I’m an equal-opportunity offender and it all goes back to comedy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Many people don’t see the humor in it. To them, Arbour asks why they would watch the video in the first place — or show their children. “I think everyone is being a little too sensitive about everything,” she said. “My video was not aimed at children. I do not make children content. It was really unfortunate that a bunch of YouTube users of pre-teen audiences shared this video as if it was a speech.”</p><p>Arbour’s six-minute video was briefly pulled down from YouTube, and has garnered over 18 million views on Facebook. In it, she says that fat-shaming is “not a thing” and dares “fat people” to chase her. Many viewers took offense, but according to Arbour, others actually enjoyed her jokes.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of people get it,” she told BBC. “I’ve had a lot of fat people say this is hilarious. I’ve had a lot of fat people message me and say, ‘You made me want to put down the Oreos and go for a jog.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKWim5%2Bhsm6t0ZumrqpdmbKnsc2dqmaclZa%2FbrLArWSpnZ%2BluaZ51aKbnqddlrqqsIyopaCnmaO0bq7AnKKlmaOdenN8kG5oanE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
