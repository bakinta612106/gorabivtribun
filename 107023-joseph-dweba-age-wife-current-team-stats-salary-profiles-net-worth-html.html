He came from a very humble background where he lived in an informal settlement with his two siblings. His father worked in the <a href=#>gold mines</a>, whereas his mother worked in a kitchen.</p><h3>Joseph Dweba's high school</h3><p class=align-left>He attended a variety of high schools namely Hoërskool Florida, Roodepoort, Hoërskool Jan Viljoen, and Randfontein. While growing up, he was <a href=#>bullied</a> by the older kids in his neighbourhood until he began working on his <a href=#>sport</a> which became his weapon.</p><p class=align-left>Joseph Dweba's wife is not always in the limelight. However, he shared a photo with her and the young son Little Khayone'nkosi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/6e355aa41688e11d.jpg><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>It is incredible how much a small ray of hope can transform an entire life. Mr Badenhorst was the new coach in town at the time, and he fired up the rugby player's dream and was someone he could lean on. The player <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>,</p>He is hardcore Afrikaans, but he had a soft spot for me. I did not understand what he was doing in my life, picking me up, taking me home, buying me food. Only now as I sit back do I realise that this guy had a huge impact on my life to get to where I am today.<p class=align-left>The player's career steadily grew, and even though other coaches down the line could not see him, he proved to them that he was a force to be reckoned with.</p><p class=align-left>Joseph Dweba's Sharks advantage came with <a href=#>Mbonambi</a> to the team. With Mbonambi gone, Dweba is high on the Stormers’ <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wish list</a>.</p><h3>Joseph Dweba <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ESPN News</a></h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>Springboks</a> is set to make ten changes for the Rugby Championship open against Argentina. The Rugby player, who is well-recognised for his mobile hooker skills, is set to be playing in the new line.</p><h3>Joseph Dweba highlights</h3><p class=align-left>The following are Joseph Dweba's stats based on the competitions he has played:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5d71e922450aacf2.png><p class=align-left>One good fortune can change your entire life, and that was true with Joseph Dweba's life. For now, he plays for Bordeaux and that is a step closer to Joseph Dweba's Springbok's dream whose jersey he promised Mr Badenhorst. His fans cannot wait to see what he has in store for them in this second half of the year.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>David Miller: age, wife, height, stats, current teams, records, net worth</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>We</a> recently published the biography of <a href=#>David Miller</a>, and it is quite an interesting read. It is more than talent; it takes a strong will, tenacity, and discipline when it comes to sports. This has been clearly evidenced in the life of the cricketer when he made history back in 2013.</p><p class=align-left>So how did it all begin, and what are some of his records?
