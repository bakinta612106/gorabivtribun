According to his date of birth, he is <strong>24 years</strong> old and is an American by nationality. Similarly, he has his belief in Christianity and has the zodiac sign of Taurus. In addition, his real name is William Wilson. However, his ethical background is still unknown.</p><p>This American YouTuber has not yet shared his family background, as well as his parents’ names and their professions. However, he has two younger siblings; a brother, and a sister whose names are unknown at the moment. Additional information regarding his early life is still not available at the moment.</p><p>Coming towards his academic background, he might have completed his high school education at a local private high school. Then, he might have earned a degree from a local university in the United States.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Career>Professional Career</span></h2><p>From an early age, he was passionate about creating content and playing video games for his audience. So, he launched his&nbsp; YouTube channel “Ceedaygaming” on the 26th of October 2015. However, he started posting videos only around April 2016 on his YouTube channel.</p><p>Back on the 30th of November 2016, he posted his debut video titled “Asylum- Trials Highlights & Loot 11/25/16” which has over 506k views and 12k likes at the moment. Initially, he did multiple montages and gameplays on Destiny as well as sometimes played other games.</p><p>In the year 2017, he began getting noticed on a larger scale when he started to edit his gaming videos to be funny, patenting what would eventually be called “Ceeday sound effects” even though he didn’t create the sound effects.</p><p>Afterward, his fan following began to increase slowly. The following year, he started using the same strategy to make his Fortnite videos, and because it was such a novel and popular game at the time, his views naturally increased and his subscriber count went from 100,000 to 2 million subscribers in just a few months.</p><p>He mentioned that he had been getting lag spikes on his Fortnite account, due to the many friend requests he was getting in May 2018. During this, he had not turned on the ‘Auto-Decline Friend Request’ setting, until he found out about the issue.</p><p>When he turned it on, he was unable to access his account and was compelled to delete it. Due to this reason, he lost his all progress all the awards he won, and all the outfits he purchased including his favorite outfits: Raptor, Raptor’s Back Bling, and the Disco Pickaxe, which he got back in June 2018.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-306881 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ceeday-YouTube-video.jpg alt=Ceeday width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-306881 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ceeday YouTube video (Source: YouTube)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCmmaOge6S7zGianp2UlsZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
