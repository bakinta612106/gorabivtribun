Zach Wilson has <a href=#>eclipsed him as the QB2</a>, and even Mac Jones and Trey Lance have picked up steam as potentially being drafted over him. The 49ers traded up to No. 3, but sent head coach Kyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch to Jones’ pro day instead of Fields’.</p><p>On “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pat McAfee Show</a>,” ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky shared information he had gathered from NFL sources as to why this may be happening.</p><p>“One, I have heard that he is a last-guy-in, first-guy-out type of quarterback,” Orlovsky said. “Like, not the maniacal work ethic. I’ve even heard it compared to Justin Herbert, where it was like, dude, when Justin Herbert showed up, he was like a psychopath when it came to working and get ready for the draft. Or even at school, like, ‘Give me more, I want to work non-stop.’ And I’ve heard that there are issues with Justin Fields’ work ethic.</p><p>“The second thing is … Where is his desire to go be a great quarterback? I think that there’s a desire to be a big-time athlete, from what is expressed to me, but where is his desire to be a great quarterback? And to be great, you gotta be willing to find the things that you are not good at and just freaking grind on them.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love a good <a href=#>@danorlovsky7</a> roast sesh as much as anybody BUT..</p><p>I think folks are missing that he was answering my question about “Why the narrative has changed about Fields so much?”</p><p>He very assertively said “These are not my opinions”</p><p>He then went on to give a potential why <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Wud0ve4tcI</a></p><p>— Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) <a href=#>March 31, 2021</a></p></figure><p>The quotes were circulated on social media, and Orlovsky received some backlash, despite the fact that the former NFL quarterback stated multiple times that these were not his opinions. Many pointed out that Fields played half of the CFP semifinal with a gnarly rib injury and threw six touchdowns, blowing out Lawrence and Clemson in the process. Hard to argue that the work ethic isn’t there considering what everyone saw on the biggest stage in college football.</p><p>There’s also the possibility that NFL front offices are deliberately putting out smokescreens, which often happens during draft season as teams try to manipulate the dialogue around certain players. Perhaps one team loves Fields and wants him to slide a bit in the draft so they can snag him.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Justin Fields<span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Orlovsky said his main concern about Fields is his throwing motion, which he described as “unnatural.” On ESPN, he dispelled other popular concerns about Fields, including the idea that he struggles going through his reads.</p><p>“If Justin Fields falls past fourth in the draft, we as an NFL community have failed,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Orlovsky said</a>. “If you hear someone say that Justin Fields can’t get through number one in his progression, stop listening to that person and walk away.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlai9r7%2BMnZinZZ%2BnubDC0qSwZp6RmLK0eceemK1llqS%2FbrbUrKuipl2btqa4w6xkpZmjqXqowdhmoKdllp6%2FtMCMoKyyZZ%2BqwW6%2BxKmmq6xf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
