In court documents filed on Tuesday in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, papers show that Garcia has accused Joby of the sexual crimes.</p><p>Furthermore, Garcia’s court documents claim the manager used common techniques that pedophiles typically employ, including grooming and seduction through the use of pornography, alcohol, and the slow crossing of personal boundaries.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2SFRtEgySq/</p><p>The lawsuit claimed that by the time he was around 16-years-old, Harte sexually abused him on a regular basis. The 37-year-old plaintiff, Harte, has been accused of grooming the underaged boy into a sexual commodity which was subsequently passed around to his friends.</p><p>According to Garcia’s lawyers, Ben Meiselas and Michael Popok, the young man’s career was “derailed” by the abuse he suffered, and will take him a lifetime to recover from. Ricky’s attornies stated that the men responsible for taking care of him instead preyed on his vulnerability as a young man.</p><p>It wasn’t until March of 2018 that Garcia finally chose to speak up about the alleged victimization he endured. Harte apparently tried to simply put the abuse aside as mere “horseplay.” Posted on Wednesday, Garcia thanked his family and friends for encouraging him to speak out on the matter.</p><p>In his social media post, Garcia stated that he hopes his coming out will help other victims of sexual abuse. This comes after the resurfaced allegations against Michael Jackson from Wade Robson and James Safechuck became a point of contention once again.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Following the airing of Leaving Neverland – which detailed the supposed abuse perpetrated by Jackson in detail – the sexual abuse of minors came a hot topic, and some people have begun questioning Michael Jackson’s legacy, however, most fans appear to have stuck by him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUnsCvsdhmqq2ZomK%2Fqq%2FKsmSgmaKYtqJ50Z6tnpmcqHqptdJmpJqmkZyys3nSnq%2BumZyhxm6twa6qnpxdnbauecWrpqZlkWLGsMHNoGSan5VigHN8kW9uaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
