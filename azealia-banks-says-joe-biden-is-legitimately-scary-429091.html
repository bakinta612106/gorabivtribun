According to Banks, if <a href=# title="Joe Biden Denies Tara Reade’s Sexual Assault Allegation, As Nancy Pelosi And Other #MeToo Champions Endorse His Bid For The Presidency">Joe Biden</a> were to win the presidency this year, it may lead to more harm than good.</p><p>Hot New Hip Hop picked up on an Instagram post from the star this week in which she reflected on an interview between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardi B,</a> the “Bodak Yellow” star, and Joe Biden. Thus far, the interview has picked up heat by foes and friends.</p><p>Banks, for one, described Joe Biden as “legitimately scary,” saying how he looked like he was a “complete racist in performative PC drag.” As most know, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamala Harris was recently announced as his running mate in this year’s election</a>, and Banks says Kamala just might save him.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CEDJuMhg6xO/</p><p>The rapper urged Kamala Harris to “save our souls,” before going on to say that Harris shouldn’t let Joe speak during the debates. As for why she doesn’t like Joe Biden, Banks said on her account that Joe has “romanticized” what was done to black Americans during the civil rights movement many years ago.</p><p>Even though Banks is obviously not a big fan of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Biden</a>, it looks like she does think positively of Kamala Harris, who reportedly led to an increased chance in the Democrats winning the election this year at least in terms of the polling numbers.</p><p>Azealia reportedly believes Kamala has the ability to take on the leading role even more so than Joe Biden. As most know, Joe has received considerable criticism over the last few weeks due to his various mid-interview blunders.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>For instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biden compared black Americans to Latino-Americans unfavorably</a>, describing Latinos as more politically diverse than their counterparts. Later, Biden apologized for his remarks and said he would never mean such a thing, but the damage was already done.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRr7KiuMiaZJuZnqDAbr%2FAsqpmop%2BaeqO1w56lZqGjYrmms8itoKaZpJq5unnSnJirsV1pf3p8mGpm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
