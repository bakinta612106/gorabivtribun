It's either all the way, with great passion being a fan, or it's nothing. That's what being a Raider fan is."&nbsp;</p><p>Are Raiders fans rowdy? &nbsp;Yes, take a look at the Black Hole and the ridiculous costumes worn by followers of the Silver and Black. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A few bad apples have given a bad reputation to the entire Raider Nation crop. &nbsp;Raider Nation is rogue and Raider Nation might get a little overzealous at times, but they aren’t a mass gathering of criminals.&nbsp;</p><p>Raiders fans are some of the most passionate fans in the league but they are looked at like a stadium-sized meeting of gangbangers anonymous. &nbsp;The Oakland Raiders organization didn’t ask Eazy-E to don a Los Angeles Raiders snapback&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in this photograph</a> but he did and now the Raiders are suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>This article won’t change the world. &nbsp;Raider Nation will continue to be the most misunderstood fanbase in professional sports but the organization should be happy that they have such a diehard fanbase. They could be Jacksonville Jaguars fans...and no one wants that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGtqaG2DdnnOmqKlmZ6ZerOtyJ2cq6tdrLW6ecWapZuZo5p6qr%2BMpqasrF2itrTBzZ2cq6ukpLylecinZKyon6fBtA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
