Both his father and grandfather were firefighters, serving as inspirations for his own career choice.</p><p>He dedicated approximately eight years to the Kern County fire department before resigning in 2014. During this period, he developed a passion for helping people, aligning with his family’s firefighting tradition.</p><p>Hearn met Sabrina while she was working at Costco, and after leaving the firefighting profession, he ventured into other businesses. He founded Hern Industrial Services, a company providing cleaning and maintenance services to factories.</p><p>Despite his initial commitment to firefighting, Hearn’s life took a dark turn. In January, he confessed to being the one who pulled the trigger in a murder case and expressed apologies to his friends and family for his actions.</p><p>Jonathan Hearn was ultimately sentenced to twenty-five years and four months in prison. During the sentencing, he acknowledged his guilt and expressed remorse, citing his Christian beliefs and referencing Scriptures. He recognized the harm caused by his choices, stating that anything short of death would be considered merciful.</p><p>The murder case involving Jonathan Hearn and Sabrina Limon even inspired a movie titled “Jonathan Hearn and Sabrina Limon,” further highlighting the sensational nature of the events.</p><h2 id=firefighter-jonathan-hearn-family>Firefighter Jonathan Hearn Family</h2><p>Jonathan Hearn was born into a Christian family, with his parents being Mike Hearn and Carol Hearn.

Notably, Jonathan and Briana divorced in 2013, a year before the murder occurred.</p><p>Despite this information, there is limited public knowledge about Jonathan Hearn’s family, as they have chosen to keep their lives private and away from the public eye.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Did Jay Rayner Gain Weight?
