Doing their best not to reveal any spoilers, the young cast thought long and hard before choosing their one word.</p><p>Laughter broke out and some of the actors tried to explain their reasoning while still protecting the integrity of the season.</p><p>Jimmy Fallon shared a video clip of his guests delivering their one-word description for the upcoming season.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The cast members of <a href=# rel=nofollow>@Stranger_Things</a> describe <a href=# rel=nofollow>#StrangerThings3</a> in one word <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/SfhCGkChp8</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#FallonTonight</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/TuQVtuyT30</a></p><p>— The Tonight Show (@FallonTonight) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 15, 2019</a></p><p>The cast has great camaraderie and it’s easy to see that they get along well in real life. They discussed some behind-the-scenes issues that occurred while they were filming and the cast spoke about filming part of Stranger Things in a mall that they believed to be haunted. Each guest shared their input and they laughed, joked and intermingled on the panel with some of them finishing another’s sentences for them.</p><p>They are a close group that has as much fun breaking some of the rules on set as they do when they make public appearances promoting the show.</p><p>They talked about how people were actually in the mall shopping while they were filming their scenes and how they were concerned that some of the mall’s patrons might take videos that could end up online and drop huge spoilers.</p><p>They also shared a song with Jimmy Fallon that Caleb made up called the “Chicken Noodle&nbsp; Soup” song. You may watch a video of the cast discussing filming with Jimmy Fallon as well as teach him how to sing the “Chicken Noodle Soup” song in the video player below.</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Are you looking forward to the Fourth of July and the premiere of Stranger Things Seasons 3?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGednrmttcRmmaiakq56o77OsKVmnpmju27DzqWdoZmimXqiusNmqq2qkaO0pr6MrZ%2BippeoeqSt0q1kr6GjnsFuwMeeZK2nnp60qcCMrJ%2Bor12owaK%2B0aKloGWanrquxYyfmKWkn6N6c4WRbmxyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
