Similarly, the EX-EFF MP says that African leaders should also retire, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TimeLIVE </a></i>reports.</p><p class=align-left>Mokoena made his views known in a tweet. Mokoena said:</p>“The world is more dynamic. When it’s your time, step aside and let younger leaders take their space.”<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Never miss breaking news – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">join</a> Briefly News' Telegram channel!</p><p class=align-left>Mokoena added that the journey towards a unified <a href=#>Africa</a> is long, and generations must understand that unity is critical to survival.</p><p class=align-left>Mokoena’s comments come on the back-end of growing concerns that the calibre of leadership on the continent leaves much to be desired.</p><p class=align-left>Mokoena’s statements echo those of Mathews Phosa, who issued a stern warning to the leaders of the <a href=#>ANC</a> in July, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">City Press</a> </i>reported. Phosa said that South Africa is crying out for competent leaders.</p><h2>South Africans weigh in</h2><p class=align-left>Some South Africans said Mokoena should direct his comments at politicians like EFF leader <a href=#>Julius Malema</a>.</p><p class=align-left>@Ramaphosa22 said:</p>“I think you should give that advice to Malema. He seems to be fighting for political power as well.”<p class=align-left>@Elsa702 commented:</p>“Cough cough, tell that to Juju...”<p class=align-left>@MashSammy added:</p>“Shout that to scuttlebutt monger Malema.”<h2>ANC to cement step-aside rule in their constitution to keep criminals and deadbeats out, members to undergo vetting</h2><p class=align-left>In a related matter, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that the African National Congress <a href=#>plans to codify</a> the hotly contested step-aside rule in the party’s constitution at the conference in December, meaning it will be a formal "law" of the ANC. The ANC plans to do this to rid the party of its undesirable members.</p><p class=align-left>The ruling party has compiled a list of constitutionally proposed amendments that address organisational renewal and membership.</p><p class=align-left>The types of individuals that ANC will not consider for membership include abusers, murderers, rapists and <a href=#>people</a> found guilty of corruption. Deadbeat parents will also not be considered for membership.</p><p class=align-left><strong>New feature:</strong> <i>check out news exactly <strong>for YOU </strong>➡️ find "Recommended for you" block and enjoy!</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLG7y6KropujZH50gpVpbWadqGKyp7KMpqdmnpGjrm65zqSmnqaRYq6nvsicmKdlnJqupbHRrGSsrJ%2Bleqe1xqGroqaXYr2wuMitoJyZnGK9sMPEq2Syp6WjtG64xJqbnqqjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
