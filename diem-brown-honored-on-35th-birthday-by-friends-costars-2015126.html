MTV stars took to Twitter and Instagram on Friday, June 12, to pay tribute to the late <strong>Diem Brown</strong> on what would have been her 35th birthday.</p><p>Alums of The Challenge and Real World honored the beautiful TV personality and encouraged followers to recognize Brown's birthday by contributing to <a href=#>her charity MedGift</a>. Before Brown's <a href=#>untimely death in November 2014 at the age of 34</a>, she founded the charitable organization in support of patients dealing with cancer or other chronic conditions.</p><p>Brown battled multiple forms of cancer for years, and detailed her first battle with the disease on the 12th season of Real World/Road Rules Challenge in 2006. She faced cancer for a second time in 2012 and went into remission in 2013 before being diagnosed for a third time in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>The late star was remembered at the time of her death and in the months since as a kind, vibrant woman with impressive strength and passions. Her fellow MTV alums including <strong>Paula Beckert, Trey Weatherholtz</strong>, and <strong>Tori Fiorenza</strong> extolled this loving spirit in birthday tributes on Friday — the same day that Brown's sister and best friends are meeting in Nashville, Tenn. to celebrate her birthday.&nbsp;</p><p>"Today is @diembrown birthday and this is how I will remember her… taking every ounce of life to the extreme," <a href=#>Beckert wrote in the caption of an Instagram shot of herself and Brown</a>. "Whether it's a costume party, a dance party or no party, Diem celebrated with every breath. I miss my friend. But today is a day for smiles, hair whips and splits."&nbsp;</p><p>"I know she is in heaven, watching over us, bringing her spirit to us when we need it most, and just making sure we are doing ok," Beckert added. "Well Diem, we are ok, but dammit life was just a lot more fun with you here. Your legacy lives on thru #medgift and the millions of moments you have blessed us with. For everyone with a dented heart, please find peace and love today on Diem's birthday. Share your pictures and stories. Hug your people extra tight. And light a candle, sing happy birthday and make a wish for our dancing angel. Forever loved, always remembered #diemstrong"</p><p>Check out other tributes to Brown below.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Happy Birthday <a href=#>@DiemBrownMTV</a> Love & miss you.
