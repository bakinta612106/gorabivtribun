LMS just might be a reality. Keep it up. Who wants more #LastManStanding?” the 64-year-old <a href=#>wrote on Twitter</a> on Thursday, May 3.</p><p><a href=# title=_self>The Hollywood Reporter</a> also just revealed that Fox is already in early talks to revive the former ABC series for a seventh season. Sources told the outlet that Tim has signed on to reprise his role as lead character Mike Baxter on the reboot. This latest update comes after other popular networks said no to bringing Last Man Standing back to TV earlier this year. It was reported in mid-June that CMT was considering renewing the show on its channel, however, it was described as a “long shot.” Shortly after, <a href=# title=_self>Fox News</a> reported that CMT wasn’t “moving forward” with the opportunity because they “couldn’t come to terms on the financials.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/last-man-standing.jpg><p>Tim on <i>Last Man Standing</i>.</p><p>And CMT isn’t the only network that previously turned down Tim’s sitcom. Another insider told Fox News that NBC also shut down the opportunity “because they have too many shows.”</p><p>After the series got the boot from ABC a few months ago, Tim took to Twitter to announce that he was not at all happy with the network’s decision. “Stunned and blindsided by the network I called home for the last six years. #LastManStanding,” he wrote on the social media platform. Following his remark, his followers were quick to wonder why the show got canceled.</p><p>ABC credited scheduling conflicts as the reason for the cancellation. “A large part of these jobs are managing failure and we’ve made the tough calls and canceled shows that we’d otherwise love to stay on the air,” ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey said. “That’s the job. I canceled Last Man Standing for the same business and scheduling reasons that I canceled Dr. Ken, The Real O’Neals, The Catch, and American Crime. And Last Man Standing was a challenging one for me because it was a steady performer in the ratings, but once we made the decision not to continue with comedies on Fridays, that was where we landed.” Here’s hoping we get to see Season 7 of Last Man Standing someday, but we also wouldn’t mind a possible revival of Tim’s other hit show, <a href=# title=_self>Home Improvement</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8uaqq1lnZa7br%2FTmqWdoZ6cerR5x6iknmWZor2zu9WepJ6mpGK%2FpsHNoqanZWRugHSB</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
