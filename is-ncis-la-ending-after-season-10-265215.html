Is it possible that NCIS: Los Angeles could be ending for good in just a few short weeks?</p><p>According to TV Insider, some fans are thinking the show is coming to an end because current storylines are dropping major hints. After Kensi (Daniela Ruah) and Deeks’ (Eric Christian Olsen) wedding, kids can’t be far behind, and, that could take them out of the field. Then in “Searching,” Eric (Barrett Foa) and Nell (Renee Felice Smith) talked about moving out of Los Angeles.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A <a href=# rel=nofollow>#JAG</a> reunion has broken out on the set of <a href=# rel=nofollow>#NCISLA</a>.

The first is because Nell’s mother has been diagnosed with Coronary Heart Disease and she is considering a treatment center in the Golden Gate City. Second, Eric has a job offer there. If they follow through with the move, that obviously takes them away from NCIS: LA.</p><p>There are also questions about Callen’s (Chris O’Donnell) future after he reunited with his sister and nephew.</p><p><a href=#>CBS has not yet announced</a> a Season 11 renewal for NCIS: Los Angeles, but their decision will be based on ratings. The numbers for Season 10 are slightly down, but overall, they are still strong in the major demos. This is a good sign for fans, but there is no guarantee the show will be back.</p><p>In the meantime, David James Elliott will reprise his JAG role in an upcoming NCIS: Los Angeles episode. Elliott will bring back the role of Navy Captain Harmon Rabb Jr. for an upcoming story arc, and the show’s executive producer, R. Scott Gemmill says that he is looking forward to working with Elliott again.</p><p>“I did the first four seasons of JAG with him, so to be able to work together again in and of itself is great – but to do so with the same character, on our show, this many years later is pretty damn amazing,” said Gemmill in a statement.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>#NCISLA</a> season 10, episode 20 promo: What will happen in Choke Point?<a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/wcocLpkyGp</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#ncislosangeles</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/0CTRfke7Zo</a></p><p>— Daily Express (@Daily_Express) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 1, 2019</a></p><p>JAG, which ran on NBC from 1995 to 1996 and on CBS from 1997 to 2005 was the show that spun off NCIS, which eventually lead to NCIS: Los Angeles and NCIS: New Orleans.
