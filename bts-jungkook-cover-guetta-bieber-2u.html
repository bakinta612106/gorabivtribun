In interviews done in the United States, Jungkook has also repeatedly expressed his interest to collaborate with Bieber, as well as Charlie Puth, whom he also covered in the past with “We Don’t Talk Anymore.”</p><p>As BTS continue to gain popularity in the United States, the group has met with several Western celebrities such as Diplo, MAJOR LAZER, and most recently, Ansel Elgort. Although some fans have guessed that a musical collaboration may happen between BTS, Diplo, and MAJOR LAZER, nothing has been confirmed. However, Diplo did caption <a href=#>a photo of himself and BTS</a> with “About to make a movie with my Korean squad.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/bts-jungkook-releases-cover-of-david-guetta-and-justin-biebers-2u-01.png alt width=1862 height=1192 sizes="(max-width: 1862px) 100vw, 1862px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Whether a collaboration may be in the works or not, fans will have a taste of BTS’ new music with the release of their upcoming project Love Yourself: Her, which will be their <a href=#>first album to be released through Amazon</a>.
