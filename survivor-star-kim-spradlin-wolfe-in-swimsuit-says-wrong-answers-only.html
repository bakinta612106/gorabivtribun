Spradlin-Wolfe, 40, shared a throwback picture of herself and fellow contestant Chelsea Meissner, both wearing bikinis while having an intense conversation on the beach. "What were we scheming about? Wrong answers only ðŸ˜‰," she captioned the post. "Our&nbsp; season of Survivor will be known as the best Season everâ€¦.trust me!" a fan commented. Here's how Spradlin-Wolfe feels about taking part in the survival show, and what her life looks like now.</span></p><p><span>Spradlin-Wolfe was thrilled to return for </span><i><span>Survivor: Winners at War</span></i><span>, but admits it was a lot harder to go away for a period of time. "So last time coming on, I was coming out of a messy divorce," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Twenty-eight years old. Single. Independent. I owned a couple of bridal salons. And since the game, I got remarried, which I'd never thought I would do. But honestly, in the game, that gave me some clarity that it was something I did want to do. So I got remarried and then had three kids about as fast as is humanly possible. So they're all within 26 months of each other. So now I have a 3, 4, and 5-year-old. And my life is sweet, honestly. It's just so good. So it was hard to leave."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_1537325582.jpg><p><span>Spradlin-Wolfe says going through childbirth toughened her up for </span><i><span>Survivor</span></i><span>. "I think I am completely the same and totally different at the same time," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I mean, I have a lot of the same attributes that I think made me good the first time. And this time around, I think I know how to grind way harder than I did last time. I mean, having three babies in three years was beyond anything I had experienced. A whole new tired. Natural childbirth. You just want to die. And so if I had to do Survivor or natural childbirth again, that would be a tossup."</span></p><p><span>Spradlin-Wolfe is proud to be a role model for women. "My mom was strong in that she would help me load a couch into the back of her truck without complaining in 100-degree weather," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "My dad was a coach and gone a lot, so we sort of learned to be resourceful as women in the Spradlin family, as there wasn't a man around to ask for help from. My dad taught me to never, ever quit. I don't know a lot about parenting yet, but I've heard that actions speak louder than words, so I'm hoping that if I'm strong, my daughter will be strong. Is that how it works?"</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Spradlin-Wolfe loves living in San Antonio, Texas. "I love that San Antonio has everything you could ever want or need and then some," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I love that San Antonio is small enough that I bump into friends while frequenting old 'standbys,' but big enough that there's always a new boutique or coffee shop to try when I have the energy to venture out. San Antonio just feels easy to meâ€”homey, reallyâ€”which is good because it's my home!"</span></p><p><span>Spradlin-Wolfe is working on her self-confidence. "I naturally don't like to praise myself, and so it's hard for me," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I think I tend to underplay myself, which, I think, would be a disservice to myself in this moment, because I think underestimating how people see me would be a mistake, so I have to be honest. And I think that they think I'm pretty legit. I'm sure that I'm on the list of names of some people that people are worried about. So if I can get through those first few days, I can get in there. If they don't come gunning for me, I'll be alright, maybe."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLTB0a%2Bgr6eiYsC1rdFmoqKlXai9s63DpaCnZaekuaexjKKlZqunnrq0wcitZKyZqah6uL7Op55mmZ6oxKa%2B0mamp6SpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
