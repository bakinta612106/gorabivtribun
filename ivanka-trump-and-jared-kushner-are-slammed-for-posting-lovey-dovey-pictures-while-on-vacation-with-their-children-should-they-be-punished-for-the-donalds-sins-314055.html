Donald Trump’s daughter posted various photos on social media of the trip together with her husband, Jared Kushner, and their three children — Arabella, Joseph, and Theodore.
It looked like everyone was having a great time indeed, although some of Ivanka’s followers have pointed out that she might have looked a bit uncomfortable with the overall setting around her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Your Dad is Destroying our environment!”</p><p>Another commenter shared: “What are those kids doing outside their cages?”</p><p>This voter wrote: “Your encompassed understanding of the immigration issue and your sarcasm (an empirically measured sign of intelligence) is wasted on the simpletons (and self-proclaimed “Christians” 🙄) that make up the Cult45.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1UrpzWhOaG/</p><p>A fourth person chimed in: “I made a pointed joke about what I believe is a moral gap in this political family’s approach to immigration. If my clearly ironic post offends you more than the president’s words and actions, I am not the one who needs to examine the hate in their heart. Good luck.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the controversy around Ivanka and her father’s policies continues to brew, and it looks like discontent with Trump’s actions in politics is starting to reach some alarming proportions.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1U0SAOBWXW/</p><p>It would be interesting to see how this all plays out in the coming 2020 election because at this point the president’s poll numbers seem to be slipping after he said he wanted to buy Greenland, claimed to be the second coming, the king of Israel, and “the chosen one.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1WaxJoBYxg/</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Still, that was not the entirety of the comments posted about Ivanka’s recent trip. Some were more supportive, with various people congratulating her and chiming in to say that they hoped that she is having a good time and they hope she will run for president one day.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeZq66vt8Bmq6utnaV6orrDZqGaqpWZeqzB0qGlnqpdlr%2BmedKlmKallZl6p7vRZqeoq6Seu6h5y6itnrFdmby3sdhmp6KbpKq%2Fpr%2BMsJ%2BipJVivK951ZqamqyZpLtuw8itn2asmJq2s3nCoaClnKKau26%2Fx6ispZxdqbWmxYybnGaopaO2tLTEnWSfp6JiwamxjJ2mp5mcmcBuv8inqmZrYWl9doGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
