His commercials with Quaker Oats featuring his father are entertaining, but there’s more to the collaboration than meets the eye. Over the years, Manning has teamed with Quaker to promote healthy living and tackle hunger and food insecurity issues.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, he worked alongside Quaker and Feeding America for the&nbsp;Quaker Hunger Clock Campaign. The effort aimed to raise $500,000 by the time&nbsp;Super Bowl LVII rolled around, funding about 5 million meals. Joining the campaign was meaningful to Manning, who wanted to be at the forefront of change. “I just like helping people going through tough times,” he told USA Today. “Obviously, America has a hunger issue, and you never want to see people that are hungry and can’t get food and can’t get nutritious food.”</p><p>The Pregrain program took many forms throughout 2023, from Manning’s commercials to&nbsp;a TikTok campaign that offered fans the chance to win Super Bowl tickets. The initiative also included a $250,000 donation to the non-profit organization&nbsp;GENYOUth, a youth wellness program providing meals for students in need.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOoqpmrJiaeqKv06ipZqGeYrKttYymmKemmaO0tHnQrpiknaJivKLA0maaqKWdmr%2BktcClZKGho2K%2Fpq3LZp2arJiav3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
