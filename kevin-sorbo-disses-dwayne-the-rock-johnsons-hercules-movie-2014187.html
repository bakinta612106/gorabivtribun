The actor—who played the title role in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys from 1995 to 1999, as well as in several made-for-TV Hercules movies—said on a red carpet recently that he thinks it's "stupid" he wasn't even given a cameo in <strong>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</strong>'s upcoming Hercules blockbuster.</p><p>"Dwayne Johnson and I used to work at the same gym for a while. He's a nice guy," the O.C. alum told <a href=#>Dish Nation</a>. That said, Sorbo doesn't appreciate not being included in the star's new film, especially since his iteration of the character was so famous in the 1990s.</p><p>"We were sort of taken aback they wouldn't let me in that movie. I didn't do a cameo. I think it's kinda stupid, really," he admitted. "I'm still on all over America, on Netflix, on Hub, on Encore. I'm still in, like, 50 countries around the world. It was the most-watched show in the world in the '90s, passing Baywatch."</p><p>But he didn't stop there. "To not me put on in a cameo…it's taking the business out of show business, and it's just kinda stupid," he continued. "We approached the director. I don't know what his reasons are—I don't know if it's political, or it's ego, or what it is. But to not put me in just for a stupid little cameo, the audience would've loved it. They would've loved it."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sorbo also has his eye on another role—but he's had no luck there, either. "They told me they were gonna put me in Expendables 2, and they never did. Maybe I'm too tall for that cast," he joked, appearing to poke fun at the franchise's stars, which include <strong><a href=#>Bruce Willis</a></strong>, <strong>Chuck Norris</strong>, <strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>, <strong>Jason Statham</strong>, and <strong>Jet Li</strong>.</p><p>"I would love to do it," Sorbo added of the action trilogy. "I'd be honored…It'd be fun for me to do that. But, you know, they don't want me there."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpJyvoZ5iwLC%2BwahknaGjqLK0ecOwmLKmlWLBqbGMq6aco12fvKm60qilrGWYmr%2Bkwcueqmaln6u2pnmRaWhtaWhs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
