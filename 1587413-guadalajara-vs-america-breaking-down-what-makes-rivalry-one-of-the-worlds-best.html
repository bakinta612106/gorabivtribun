So much so, that winning this weekend's fixture—the rivalry game—will be more important than where they finish in the domestic league.</p><p>It's that&nbsp;big of a deal.</p><p>Where did the rivalry come from and why is it such a big deal? Let's take a look at the history of the two clubs, and what makes them oppose the other so much.</p><p>Considered the two most popular teams in Mexico, El Super Clasico first began in the 1950s when the two teams squared off in the Mexican League.</p><p>After Chivas won the first game 1-0, America spanked their highly fancied opponents 7-2 in the next game, and thus the rivalry was seemingly born.</p><p>However, due to the struggles that America faced throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there wasn't as much of a rivalry other than between fans. After all, if one of the teams involved isn't that competitive, it's hard to get all that excited about beating an opponent.</p><p>Yet, after&nbsp;Fernando Marcos took over America and made them into a strong team—which coincided with Chivas' domestic dominance—the rivalry was flourishing once more heading into the 1980s, which is when the Clasico rivalry really started to come into existence.</p><p>The classic 1983 brawl—known as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“La&nbsp;Bronca&nbsp;de 83”</a>—which came in the semifinals of the 1982-83 season, showed just how great the passion really was between the two sets of players, clubs and indeed, supporting groups as well.</p><p>Since that date, the rivalry has continued to flourish as both teams became stronger and stronger throughout the Mexican domestic competition.&nbsp;The closeness of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two teams in terms of talent</a> now has made the rivalry one of the best in the world and will no doubt continue to do so.</p><p>Yet, whilst their success might be close, their fundamental differences in identity and style will surely allow their rivalry to continue for many years to come.</p><p>Province versus capital, all-Mexican power against a team infused with foreign talent and side known for promoting youth teamers versus one famous for its big-name, expensive stars.&nbsp;The traditional ingredients of Mexico’s clasico between Chivas de Guadalajara and Club America are well-known and the fundamentals of a fierce soccer rivalry.</p><p>And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to comments</a>&nbsp;from players and managers on both teams heading into this one, the rivalry is definitely alive and healthy.</p><p>"For me, it’s a game that you can’t lose for anything in the world," said Chivas midfielder Jorge Enriquez. "I see it as a final. Results, the league position is forgotten, everything is forgotten."</p><p>Striker Miguel Sabah said "it’s a football war in which losing is banned."</p>Tom Marshall <span class=acct>@mexicoworldcup</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>America's Maza Rodriguez on the reception he will receive from Chivas fans: "I'm not playing against the public, I'm playing 11 rivals."</p><p>With a huge crowd expected and a potential playoff spot on the line, the emotion and passion will no doubt come to the fore once more when Chivas Guadalajara take on Club America, and the El Super Clasico rivalry writes its latest chapter in history.</p><p>Not that there was ever going to be another option.</p><p><strong>Is Chivas Guadalajara and Club America the best rivalry in world football?</strong></p><p>Comment below or hit me up on Twitter: &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5wZ2l%2BdHnGrpidmZyWt6K%2BwGatrGWRorKztcKaZJuqlZa4qrrGZpuor55ixKmt02akmqOVqHqztdWao6uxXaS7pnnOn2StoJVixLC%2By52qZpqVqME%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
