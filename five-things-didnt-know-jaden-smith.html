I know what you all are thinking: what would be tough about being in a rich and famous family who can get you anything you want? Truth is, that is not all life is about. Sometimes, you want to carve out your own niche without being judged by the last name you have. A good example of this is <a href=#>Jaden Smith</a>. Though he is from the super popular Smith family, he wants to be judged on his own talent and merits. Here are five things you didn’t know about Jaden Smith.</p><p>(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for KCA)</p><p><strong>Broke Into Acting At Six Years Old</strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/145136514.jpg width=594 height=395 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>At six years old, I am pretty sure the only thing I was doing was trying to sneak cookies and trying to take control of my sister’s Barbie dolls. But not Jaden Smith. When he was six, he took his first acting gig on the show his Mom and Dad produced based on their family life called All Of Us on UPN.</p><p>Though the show did not last very long, it was the first time Jaden had been bitten by the proverbial acting bug.</p><p>(Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>He Is Good Friends With Justin Bieber</strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/142235390.jpg width=594 height=474 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There is something about being young and famous that just makes these stars gravitate towards each other. It is like they know that the other one understands, and they find comfort in that. They also roll deep in a lot of the same friend circles. Another famous face in those circles is…</p><p><strong>Kylie Jenner and Him Have Been “Friends” For Years</strong></p><p>(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/186183779.jpg width=594 height=405 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Some even dare speculate that these two might be (or may have been at one time) more than friends, publicists insist they are just good friends who have known each other for quite some time and enjoy hanging out now and then. It makes sense if you think about it. They both know what being from a famous family can be like, so they relate and have worked a friendship off of that dynamic. But, if you think she is his girlfriend, guess what…..</p><p>(Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>He Thinks He Is Too Young Too Have A Girlfriend</strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/151650579.jpg width=594 height=395 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As Jaden Smith mentioned in a <a href=#>Q&A with Details </a>is that he knows he is too young to have a girlfriend, and that having girlfriends “complicates” things. He says that is the warning he gets from adults, and as of right now, he believes it. Man, that is a pretty progressive thought for a young man to have when he has so much power. Good to see he is not abusing it with the young ladies. That says a lot about his character.</p><p>(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>His Next Movie, Amulet, Will Co-Star His Famous Sister, Willow</strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/168229822.jpg width=594 height=382 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The next time you see Jaden Smith on the big screen, it will be along side his little sister, Willow. Willow is famous in her own right (I Whip My Hair Back and Forth) and it seems natural these two would share some screen time at some point. They say the apple never falls far from the tree, and considering the tree these two fell from, that makes a lot of sense.</p><p>See, so as much as you may think of Jaden Smith as the son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett, there is clearly much more going on. It will be interesting to see how his career plays out over the years, and how much he actually ends up being like his mega-star father and mother.</p><p>(Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYsGptc2gqmacmZm7tXnKp6awZZqWsaa6jKykoqyYZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
