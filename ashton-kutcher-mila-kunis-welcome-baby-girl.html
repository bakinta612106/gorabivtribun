Kunis, 31, has been prepping for the arrival of her first daughter for many weeks, taking prental classes, engaging in prenatal yoga, and talking about her choice for a natural birth. There is no confirmation from the actress whether or not she was able to make her birth plan happen, but the baby is healthy and here and that’s what’s important at the end of the day.</p><p>This is just another exciting moment for the celebrity couple after what can only be described as the most exciting year of their lives. It was only in February that the pair announced their plans to marry. It was a month later when the world found out Kunis was expecting, and it’s been several weeks since we realized she was due any day now and began watching for news of a new celebrity baby in the world.</p><p>After announcing her pregnancy, Kunis made an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she told the talk show host all about her plans for pregnancy. “I’m going to do it as all natural as I possibly can unless there’s an emergency or something that should go wrong. I did this to myself, I might as well just do it right. I wanted this!” she said.</p><p>And she’s not the only new parent excited about her new baby. Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher’s co-star on Two and a Half Men, told the media, “Ashton has even been excited every time we had a child actor on set. He loves kids and could not be more stoked to have a child.”</p><p>(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiYrKCkpLtut9StmqGdomK6qrjAZqKuppmoerixy5ympp1dl66jxYygoKukXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
