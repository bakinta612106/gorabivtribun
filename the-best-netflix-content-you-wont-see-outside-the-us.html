The same cannot be said in all jurisdictions, however, so you’re likely to miss this when traveling overseas.</p><p>Fortunately, of course, there’s now plenty of advice on <a href=#>how to get American Netflix when you are abroad</a>, meaning that you need no longer go without your favorite programs. With this in mind, here are three of the best shows that you can only see on Netflix in the U.S.</p><h3>House</h3><p>House (<a href=#>otherwise known as House, M.D.</a>) is an American medical drama that originally ran on the Fox network for a grand total of eight seasons.</p><p>Starring Hugh Laurie as the unconventional medical genius Dr. Gregory House, the show saw a team of talented diagnosticians attempts to cure the unknown ailments of various patients.</p><p>Developed by Paul Attanasio and David Shore, who took credit for creating the original idea and the House’s sardonic character, the show was extremely popular in the U.S. throughout its eight seasons and remains a hit on Netflix to this day.</p><p>Interestingly, it also retains a cult following in the UK, which is why it seems such a shame that the franchise is not available on our own iteration of Netflix.</p><h3>Futurama</h3><p>Next up is the hit American animated comedy Futurama, which is the brainchild of <a href=#>Simpsons creator Matt Groening</a>.</p><p>Once again, this show aired on Fox during its infancy, as viewers followed the miscellaneous adventures of slacker Philip J. Fry and his army of misfit cohorts.</p><p>Airing on Fox between March 28th, 1999 and August 10th, 2003, the show ran for 140 episodes and has since enjoyed numerous re-runs on channels throughout the U.S. and the UK.</p><p>These episodes are only available on the American version of Netflix, however, and there’s no sign that this will change in the future. Interestingly, the show has also been revised in numerous forms since its initial run ended, and it retains cult popularity to this day.</p><h3>The Walking Dead</h3><p>The Walking Dead is a smash hit whichever way you look at it, with this American, post-apocalyptic horror franchise having run for nine superb series and counting.</p><p>Developed by Frank Darabont and based on the comic book series by Robert Kirkman, the franchise follows the story of sheriff’s deputy Rick Grimes, who wakes from a coma to discover a world overrun by man-eating zombies.</p><p>Not only has the show become a huge hit with U.S. audiences, but it’s also earned rave reviews from viewers in the UK and throughout the rest of the world.</p><p>Despite this, the show remains unavailable on the UK version of Netflix, with licensing agreements preventing this from being shared. This is reason enough by itself to access a free VPN and tap into your favorite U.S. shows, and like we say this has never been easier or safer than it is now!a</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kwamxjJucrKxdo7K1ssuir2abn6PBprrTZrCorV2svK%2FAjKycnmWfqsG0tcOeZK2glWLCtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
