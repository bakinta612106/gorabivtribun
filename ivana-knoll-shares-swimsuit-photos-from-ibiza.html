In a recent social media post the Croatian model poses up a storm while vacationing in Spain, grabbing attention in her pink swimsuit. "Love you all," she captioned the series of Instagram snaps. "Love you too," responded one of her followers. "Sexy," added another. How does the 30-year-old influencer stay in shape? Celebwell rounded up some of her top health and fitness habits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ivana love jet skiing. Not only is the water sport fun, but per </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Health Fitness Revolution</span></a><span>, the average 150-pound rider will burn a surprising 238 calories during a half-hour ride. The sport is also great for cardiovascular endurance.</span></p><p><span>Because Ivana is so active, she makes sure to hydrate. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>, hydration is important for a variety of reasons. Water helps get rid of waste through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements, keeps your temperature normal, lubricates and cushions joints, and helps protect sensitive tissues.</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Ivana loves soccer. "</span><span>What is your favourite sport? You know mine," she captioned a post this year of herself kicking around a ball. </span><span>Mercedes Carnethon, MD, told the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>American Heart Assocation</span></a><span> that soccer is a great workout for many reasons. "It is a game of continuous running and with very little stopping," said Carnethon, an associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago. "It also has anaerobic elements – that high intensity where you're sprinting and then resting – you're constantly moving." Sports researcher Peter Krustrup, who has spent more than 15 years studying the health benefits of soccer, added that recreational-level play and soccer-related exercise drills can help reduce cholesterol and blood pressure. Soccer also can help shift body composition by decreasing fat and increasing lean muscle.</span></p><p><span>Ivana dances away the calories. "I enjoy dancing, not just in sake of having a fit body, but also for its calming impact on me. Consequently, I will probably dance as much as I could until the pageant, in order of reaching mentioned state of calmness and restlessness," she tells&nbsp; </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Angelopedia</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In her latest post, Ivana lays on her paddleboard. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The American Council on Exercise</span></a><span> (ACE) agrees that paddle boarding is great for the core and also a great form of cardio. The water sport can burn an average of 385 calories for a 140 pound male and 436 for a female the same size, per a study conducted by Arizona State University.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKrCwKeYZqOepLmtedKhmKudo2LAuLXMrKyirF2ltbDAzqxkn6qfonqqrsizmGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
