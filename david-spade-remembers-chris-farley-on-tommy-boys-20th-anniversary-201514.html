The Joe Dirt 2 actor remembered his former Saturday Night Live costar in honor of their film Tommy Boy's 20th anniversary on Tuesday, Mar. 31.</p><p>"I'm told that today is the 20th anniversary of Tommy Boy. Aside from that making me older than f—k I have to say thanks to everyone who has said nice things to me over the years," Spade, 50, began in a Facebook post. "I was very lucky to be in this movie with one of the all time funniest mother f—-rs the late great Chris Farley."</p><p>Spade and Farley, who died at 33 in 1997 of an accidental drug overdose, starred in the laugh-out-loud comedy in 1995. (Does "Fat guy in a little coat!" ring a bell?)</p><p>I'm told that today is the 20th anniversary of Tommyboy. Aside from that making me older than fuck I have to say thanks…</p><p>Posted by <a href=#>David Spade</a> on <a href=#>Tuesday, March 31, 2015</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Spade also shared a photo of the film's poster, which was signed by Farley. "It's hard to read but on the poster it says, 'David lets stick together!' Signed by Chris," he wrote. "We gave each other autographed posters as a joke back then. Now I see it in my office and skim over it because if I think about that for more than 5 seconds I'll start bawling. Like now." He joked: "As Chris would say. What a pussy. #RIP."</p><p>The stars were the best of friends, but oddly enough, Spade didn't attend Farley's funeral. The Grown Ups 2 actor explained why during a <a href=#>Reddit AMA</a> in April 2014.</p><p>"I think about him all the time. We had such a good time for so long and we were crammed together for so long that we did have our squabbles, but I think people misunderstood me not going to that funeral," he said at the time. "It was nothing about that. It was just too. . . emotional and I wouldn't be able to handle it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJuarpmZerS8wJ2cZqqVorKursSrqmabmKe2tHnFmqmlnalivK9506ikprFdl7y6v4xrZ62gXZa7r7XVnqmsmaKuenN8kG5obQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
