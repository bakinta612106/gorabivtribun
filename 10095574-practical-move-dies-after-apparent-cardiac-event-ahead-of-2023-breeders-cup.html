That in turn sparked a suspension of racing operations at the track beginning <a href=# rel=noopener>June 7</a>. It <a href=# rel=noopener>reopened</a> on Sept. 14 after new safety measures were implemented.</p><p>At Santa Anita alone, 42 horses died in 2019 at the track. That number <a href=# rel=noopener>fell to 12</a> in 2022 but has now risen again. <a href=# rel=noopener>Fox 11 Los Angeles</a> provided more information.</p><p><i>"Prior to Tuesday's death of Practical Move, Santa Anita had seen 12 horses die from a racing or training injury this year, with another eight racehorses dying from "other" causes, according to the California Horse Racing Board. Santa Anita officials have touted safety improvements that have brought down the annual number of fatalities since 2019, when 42 horses died at the track, sparking widespread debate about safety issues at Santa Anita and about horse racing in general."</i></p><p>Practical Move, a three-year-old colt, won the Grade II San Felipe Stakes in March and the Grade I Santa Anita Derby in April. He was set to compete in the Kentucky Derby before spiking an elevated temperature, leading to trainer Tim Yakteen <a href=# rel=noopener>scratching him</a> from the race.</p><p>Practical Move stayed out of competition until October 6, <a href=# rel=noopener>when he won</a> a $63,700 allowance optional claimer at Santa Anita Park by four lengths.</p><p>Santa Anita Park will be the home of this year's Breeders' Cup, which is scheduled to take place on <a href=# rel=noopener>Friday and Saturday</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWqCeICMqamam6SesKK4jKamr51dmbamv4yana2domKusbzAq5ynrF2YrrOwyJqaZp2mmru1ecChnJqcXaSzbn6Pa2pmmqKasqWx0axknK2g</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
