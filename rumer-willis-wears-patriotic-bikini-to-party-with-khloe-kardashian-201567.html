She may be sidelined from Dancing With the Stars: Live!&nbsp;touring performance company, but that didn't stop an injured <a href=#><strong>Rumer Willis</strong></a> from partying in her patriotic bikini in Las Vegas over the weekend. The DWTS Season 20 champ, 26, made her way to Las Vegas on Saturday, July 4, to celebrate Independence Day with none other than <a href=#><strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong></a>.</p><p>"Happy birthday, U.S.," Willis <a href=#>Instagrammed</a> on Saturday, posing in a teeny red, white, and blue bikini at Encore Beach Club alongside stylist Maeve Reilly.</p><p>Willis sported an ankle boot to protect her injured right foot Saturday, but made sure to match it to her LBD the next night when singing during the DWTS live tour performance at the Venetian hotel. "So excited to be back on stage w/ my #DWTS Fam tonight for the #DWTSlivetour," Willis said on Instagram.</p><p>As the DWTS tour winds its way across the U.S. this summer, Willis intends to make the most of her appearances — whether she's singing or, eventually, dancing again. "It was one of those . . . injuries that you get as a dancer," Willis told<strong> Us</strong> of her fracture. "You kind of just have to work through the pain, but unfortunately it is something that I have to actually rest and take it easy for a little while."</p><p>"I am going to sing for a little bit," she continued. "But hopefully in the last couple dates I'll be able to dance."</p><p>While Willis hung with her DWTS costars, Kardashian was busy elsewhere in Vegas. On Saturday night, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 31, had <a href=#>dinner with NBA pro</a> <strong>James Harden</strong> at the Wynn hotel's Red 8 restaurant. Later, they hit Drai's nightclub to catch <strong>Chris Brown</strong>'s performance. "Khloe and James are not officially dating though and are just friends hooking up," a source told <strong>Us</strong> of the pair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKmupZWneri1y6WgrGWnmq6zv4ypmK2qmaTBqq%2BMm6CkoZ6eerW7jKmYq6ypYsSqwMdmoqGkn5p6rK3RnZisoJmWu25%2Bj2psb28%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
