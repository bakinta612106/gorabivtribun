According to Radar Online, Richards filed documents in Los Angeles Superior Court last month requesting the court’s help with making Sheen pay up."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At the same time, he diverted over $600,000 in assets to family members and spent thousands of dollars in cash.</p><p>Richards and Sheen share two children – Sam, 15, and Lola, 14. And, even though Sheen was once worth an estimated $125 million and the highest-paid actor on television, Richards says he has burned through most of that cash to fund his high-end lifestyle and he is moving around what he has left in order to avoid paying her child support.</p><p>Sheen has denied his ex-wife’s allegations, telling The Blast that Richards and her lawyers “traffic only in fiction.” The Platoon star called Richards a “coward,” and he says his day in court is painfully overdue. Ultimately, Sheen says the truth will prevail.</p><p>Sheen’s financial situation has changed significantly in the last decade, as he has gone from starring in the number one sitcom on TV to an actor who can’t find work. In his effort to lower his child support payments to his other ex-wife, Brooke Mueller, he claimed in court documents that the entertainment industry has blacklisted him, and that has “resulted in a significant reduction” in his earnings.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The 'RHOBH' couple wed in Malibu on September 8, 2018. <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/yjOomTyyZV</a></p><p>— OK!
