Here’s what the 77 year old star had to say about his condition.</p><p>A few days after a number of different media outlets reported that <a href=# title="Robert De Niro Thinks That More Could’ve Been Done To Fight Coronavirus In The US"><strong>Robert De Niro</strong></a> suffered a rather ‘mild leg injury,’ the star shared how that happened and also talked about his state in the aftermath.</p><p>It turns out that De Niro’s hurt his leg while on location of his new project, a movie titled Flower Moon.</p><p>While chatting with IndiWire, Robert De Niro updated fans on his injury and recovery, saying that ‘I tore my quad somehow. It is just a simple stepping over something and I went down.’</p><p>It sounds like it was not really that bad but the actor stressed that the pain he felt at the time was nothing short of ‘excruciating.’</p><p>He added that ‘Now I have to get it fixed. But it happens, especially when you get older, you just have to be prepared for unexpected things. But it is manageable.’</p><p>The injury occurred in Oklahoma, where he was shooting the movie and had to fly to New York to get medical help.</p><p>The good news is that his leg injury is not expected to delay the production in any way and that is thanks to the type of character he portrays.</p><p>He dished that ‘What I’m doing with Scorsese in Killers of the Flower Moon, I’m pretty much a sedentary character in a way. I don’t move around a lot, thank god. So we’ll manage. I just have to get the procedure done and keep it straight in a certain position and let it heal.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The upcoming movie has an amazing cast of big names in the industry, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jesse Plemons and Lily Gladstone.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeipK%2BmvtNmm55lnp6%2FsHnUqZuarJWoeqetzaxkqKZdqbKzvsibo55lnJq0brXNo6yrsV2ptaZ5z5qgp2WnlsBusdecqa6bmZbBqrrGZmtxb2dmgHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
