&#34;There are plenty of teams out there that see him stepping into a backup point guard role and there was plenty of frustration both from his camp and the rest of the league when he didn't move at the deadline,&#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was eligible for restricted free agency in 2024, and he was staring at a stacked backcourt, one in which he was struggling to carve out a role.</p><p>Pritchard's 48 appearances and 13.4 minutes per game were both the lowest of his career, and he logged a total of 57 minutes in the postseason.</p><p>Then came an offseason that dramatically altered the Celtics roster and Pritchard's position within it.</p><p>Out went Marcus Smart in the trade for Kristaps Porziņģis, and then Malcolm Brogdon was included in the deal to land Jrue Holiday. That Pritchard stuck around through the transformation seemingly symbolized a strong endorsement from the team, and he became the No. 3 guard behind Holiday and Derrick White.</p>Jack Simone <span class=acct>@JackSimoneNBA</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Payton Pritchard on a potential expanded role for Celtics &lt;a href="https://t.co/HYaaC4tXff">pic.twitter.com/HYaaC4tXff&lt;/a></p>Hardwood Paroxysm <span class=acct>@HPbasketball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The funniest part of this is that Pritchard wanted a trade because he wasn't getting playing time and now all the guys in front of him are gone. &lt;br>&lt;br>Is Payton Pritchard a warlock/</p><p>The 2020 first-round pick will always be limited somewhat by his size, and he's not an explosive athlete. Because of that, it's difficult to envision him making a major breakthrough, not unlike the one Jalen Brunson enjoyed in his final year with the Dallas Mavericks in 2021-22.</p><p>But Pritchard has shown enough to think he can become a very good backup point guard or spot starter.</p><p>Through his first three years, he averaged 15.1 points, 4.7 rebounds and 4.0 assists per 36 minutes, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Basketball Reference</a>. His jumper has steadily improved as well, to the point where he knocked down 40 percent of his long-range opportunities in 2022-23.<br></p><p>Because he's still somewhat unproven in a higher-usage role, one wondered whether Pritchard would wait until next summer before he seriously considered signing an extension.</p><p>Going back to the Brunson example, he <a href=#>could've signed</a> for four years and $55.5 million if the Mavs had offered it, and instead he penned a <a href=# rel=noopener>four-year, $104 million</a> deal with the New York Knicks months later.</p><p>It's doubtful that kind of payday would've been forthcoming for Pritchard under any circumstances, but he could easily outperform his new contract and come to regret not waiting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ22Gc4GMnJylrJmYwG68wLKrqKZdpb%2BqwMKhmKucXZa0s7HEZquoZWRixqat0WZqaaVdmLyvwNGamq1lla3BprrSoqanZZGbwaa%2BjK2pmpyVYr%2B2uc6rqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
