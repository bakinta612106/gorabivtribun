"Gotta be fresh to stay on the grind," he continued.</p><p>Several hours after his detox tea post, Disick shared yet another update on Instagram, this time of his dinner in another promotional post. The reality star, who has millions of followers on his various social media accounts, gets paid an average of $25,000 per promotional social media post.</p><p>"This little dish makes me happy," the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star wrote, alongside a shot of his healthy dinner: rice noodles sprinkled with scallions, sprouts, and more. The post, however, appeared to be promotional for the Wine and Dine app, which he tagged in the social media update.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Us Weekly </strong>confirmed</a> on July 6, that he and Kardashian, 36, were splitting after nine years together, after Disick was photographed in the South of France partying with his ex-girlfriend <strong>Chloe Bartoli. </strong>"They were all over each other and so blatant," one eyewitness told<strong> Us</strong> at the time. "She was nuzzling her head on his shoulder, and he was stroking her arm and thighs."</p><p>Since the shocking breakup news, Disick has sporadically posted on his social media accounts, though largely for promotional purposes. However, on the 3rd birthday of his little girl, Penelope, he shared a personal message with his 9.5 million-plus followers on Instagram.</p><p>"1 of the only things I'm proud off about myself," the father of<strong> Mason</strong>, 5, Penny, 3, and <strong>Reign</strong>, 7 months, wrote alongside a collage of photos of his one and only daughter.
