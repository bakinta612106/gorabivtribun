You have changed my life and have single handedly made this world a kinder place (thank you for that) and we are all better off to simply know that you exist. I like you a lot and I hope you have a really fun birthday. Hugs and kisses all over you pretty little face.”</p><p>“I asked him, I said, ‘Send me a list of what kinds of things Lauren likes, and then we can maybe figure something out,'” Kimmel continued. “Let me tell you, your husband knows a lot about you. My wife was very mad at me after reading this list. It was really unbelievable.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Handing Parsekian a wrapped present, Kimmel explained, “One thing that Aaron told me is that you love Radiohead, the band Radiohead… Well, so, we contacted Radiohead, and they did not get back to us. But we did get you something special…”</p><p>As a close second to the alternative band, Kimmel kept with the “radio” theme and presented the birthday girl with a gift card to RadioShack.</p><p>See what Kimmel did with Pareskian’s preferences for <strong>Diana Ross</strong> and outer space in the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOmpirp55ivaLBy2aqrqqgp7a0sdJmrqKelWK5osHRnqVmqJGnwKa3yJqlZq%2BZqbVursirq6Gcka56sb7ErJynrKNif3F9k3Joaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
