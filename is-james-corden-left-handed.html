Along with 90% of the world’s population, Corden writes with his right hand. He has been spotted dozens of times signing autographs and he is definitely not a southpaw.</strong></p><p>Read more below to learn about James Corden’s career and about other talk show hosts who are left-handed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>From London to Late Night</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>James Corden</a> was born and raised in the Greater London area. Unlike many celebrities, Corden did not pursue acting or comedy as a child, and he did not take the stage until he was 18-years old.</p><p>Corden acted in a variety of television shows, commercials, and lesser known films before finding meager success with Fat Friends and History Boys. It wasn’t until James Corden came up with the idea for the hit U.K. show, <a href=# rel=noopener>Gavin and Stacey</a>, that he rose to fame in the British media.</p><p>The show was a critical and commercial hit, but Corden was still relatively unknown across the pond. It was not until Corden was picked as the successor to Craig Ferguson to host The Late Late Show that his Hollywood star began to rise.</p><p>You can see James Corden signing autographs for eager fans with his right hand in the YouTube video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Late Night and Daytime Lefties</h2><p>The show has been <a href=# rel=noopener>a huge success</a> with Corden as host since 2015, but James Corden has a lot of stiff competition, not only in the late night category, but also with talk show hosts in general. Here’s a list of some of the most famous left-handed late night and daytime television hosts.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Oprah Winfrey</a> is the most famous, most successful talk show host that has ever graced the small screen. With a fortune estimated at $2.9 billion and a <a href=# rel=noopener>talk show</a> that ran for 25 years, the woman is one of the most successful left-handed people on the planet.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Jon Stewart</a> is known for his biting political commentary and scathing sarcasm on current events during his time as host of The Daily Show, which the comedian hosted for 16 years , with the show <a href=# rel=noopener>winning 22 Emmys</a> during his tenure as host.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Matt Lauer</a>, who co-hosted the Today show at NBC for two decades is a lefty, as is co-host Savannah Guthrie. That’s two southpaws in a single show.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Whoopie Goldberg</a> might not have started out as a talk show host, instead working for years as an EGOT-winning actress, but now she co-hosts The View.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Right Handedness Personality Traits and a Massive Payday</h2><p>Regardless of all the southpaw competition on the talk show host circuit, Corden is still one of the most beloved talk show hosts on air at the moment. Though the British funnyman had <a href=# rel=noopener>considered moving back home </a>to England to be closer to his family, he recently <a href=# rel=noopener>extended his contract</a> until 2022.</p><p>Though there is no guarantee, it might be James Corden’s right-handed dominance that played a part in the decision. Right-handed individuals are <a href=# rel=noopener>thought to be</a> more analytical and more pragmatic in approaches to business and finance, while left-handed people are more creative and look at the bigger picture rather than the details.</p><p>Corden’s <a href=# rel=noopener>new contract</a> is estimated to be worth $5 million per year, meaning the comedian will have a $10 million payday coming to him by the time his contract is up. Racking up a multi-million dollar payday is a shrewd business decision, and if one chooses to believe in the myths surrounding handedness, James Corden being right-handed helped play a role in this massive salary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZqKRorK0ecKoqZ2dnmK5prLTZp%2BappSasXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
