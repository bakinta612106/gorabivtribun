Her year of birth is not clear, with many reporting that she was born in 1999 (which cannot be true as she is the elder sister of Zendaya, who was born in 1996).</p><p>Her birthdate was confirmed in an <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">IG post</a> by her father, Kazembe Coleman, who made it known that he had two daughters whose birthdays were in September (with the other daughter being Zendaya, who was born on September 1).</p><p>Unlike most celebrity siblings who live off the fame of their sibling, Katianna seems to be different. So far, she has shown no interest in basking in her sibling’s fame and prefers to live her life away from the public’s reach.</p><h2><strong>Zendaya and Katianna are Half Siblings</strong></h2><p>It is a known fact that Zendaya’s mother is Claire Stoermer, a former high school teacher. Seeing that Katianna is Zendaya’s sister, it is expected that they share both parents, but Zendaya’s father, Kazembe Ajamu Coleman, made a post on Instagram that made the media suspect that Zendaya and Katianna may be half-sisters after all.</p><p>On the 9th of September 2019, Kazembe Ajamu Coleman shared a picture of himself and two women with his hands holding their waists. While we were able to identify one of the women as Claire Stoermer – who is Zendaya’s mother, the identity of the second woman in the photograph was not known.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/00175e9e6eb8f2f8-1.jpg><p>That could have been regarded as the couple’s picture with a friend of the family; however, the part of the picture that left more questions than answers was the caption. While <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">uploading the picture</a>, Kazembe interestingly gave the post a caption that suggested that the other woman is indeed the mother of some of his children, as he referred to both women as his baby mamas.</p><p>Despite the level of curiosity the post raised, no one has come out to clarify the assumptions. So, if Zendaya and Katianna do not share the same mother (as is widely speculated), it means the identity of Katianna Stoermer Coleman’s mother is still a mystery.</p><h2><strong>Katianna Stoermer Coleman Has Five Siblings</strong></h2><p>Katianna Stoermer Coleman is lucky to have a big family; she has five siblings, including Zendaya. However, just like her, most of her siblings prefer to live low-profile life. Meet her siblings:</p><h3><strong>Austin Stoermer Coleman</strong></h3><p>Austin Stoermer Coleman is Katianna’s elder brother. There are reports that he may have been born to Kazembe Coleman before the latter met Zendaya’s mother. Just like Katianna, Austin also keeps a low profile. He doesn’t have any social media handles, but according to Hollywood life, Austin Stoermer Coleman is an actor.</p><h3><strong>Annabella Stoermer Coleman</strong></h3><p>Annabella Stoermer Coleman is Zendaya’s older sister and Katianna’s younger sister. We can’t say for sure if she shares the same mother as Zendaya. Annabella also keeps a low profile and does not have any known social media accounts.</p><h3><strong>Julien Stoermer Coleman</strong></h3><p>Julien Stoermer Coleman is Katianna Stoermer Coleman’s brother. Julien has followed Katianna’s footsteps by living a low-profile life. He does not have any known social media accounts.</p><h3><strong>Zendaya Stoermer Coleman</strong></h3><p>Zendaya Stoermer Coleman is Katianna’s most famous sibling. She was born on the 1st of September 1996 into the family of Kazembe Ajamu Coleman and Claire Stoermer. Zendaya started her career as a fashion model for brands like Old Navy, Macy’s, and Mervyns. In 2012, she landed her first film role in the Disney Original Frienemies.</p><p>Since then, she has been featured in other movies like; Spiderman – Far From Home, Space Jam: A New Legacy, Spiderman – No Way Home, and Is That Black Enough For You?!?. She has also been featured in television series like Black-ish, Euphoria, Lip Sync Battle, The OA, and Walk The Prank to mention but a few.</p><p>Aside from being a prolific actor, Zendaya is also a talented singer. She has released a few songs, including All of Me, My Baby, Watch Me, and Swag It Out.</p><p>In 2022, Zendaya was recognized by Times Magazine as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. She is also a two-time Primetime Emmy award winner and is considered a fashion icon and advocate. The beautiful star loves animals so much that she is a vegetarian.</p><h3><strong>Kaylee Stoermer Coleman</strong></h3><p>Kaylee Stoermer Coleman is Katianna’s youngest sibling. She has made some red-carpet appearances with Zendaya. Just like her elder siblings, not much is known about Kaylee.</p><h3><strong>Katianna Coleman May Have Other Siblings That We Don’t Know</strong></h3><p>We have always believed that Katianna Stoermer Coleman has five siblings, but that may not be the case, as Kazembe Coleman has suggested that he may have other children that the public does not know about.</p><p>On the 18th of October, he shared a picture of a young and beautiful woman holding a child. He captioned the post, “My firstborn, Latonja Coleman, and my teenage boo!” And since Latonja Coleman is not one of the popularly known siblings of Katianna Stoermer Coleman, we are left with no choice but to suspect that there may be other children we do not know about.</p><h2><strong>Katianna and Zendaya Seem to Have a Good Relationship</strong></h2><p>Although Katianna Stoermer Coleman does not want to bask in the fame of her sister, she has remained very supportive. In a birthday post, Zendaya made for her elder sister – who is believed to be Katianna – she thanked her sister for always being there for her and for teaching her what it takes to be a woman.</p><p>According to Zendaya, her sister taught her that being a woman is not just about styling your hair and smelling nice but rather about carrying yourself well and caring for yourself and others.</p><p>Lastly, it is noteworthy to add that Katianna Stoermer Coleman may be married with children. Zendaya always talks about her nieces and nephews, and she loves them so much.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmajkam2orrNmmSsrJ%2Bav66x0WaaqKSVoq6vedmepZ2ZqZbAbr%2FIrKueql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
