I feel like if a man gave me acres, I would feel obligated to stay with him if it didn’t work because that is such a good gift.”</p><p>Aside from remarks from Beauvais’ and “The Real” co-hosts <strong>Adrienne Bailon-Houghton</strong>, <strong>Loni Love</strong> and <strong>Jennie Mai-Jenkins</strong>, Fletcher has also been defending her 28.8 acre-purchase of love against fans on social media.</p><p>On Sept. 28, Fletcher wrote, “Y’all don’t know the half of what he does for me mentally or financially. I’ve never felt so safe, loved, spoiled and happy with a person. He loves me and my son so much. I’m sorry that you haven’t experienced a love like this. Focus on getting your own land and your husband.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y’all don’t know the half of what he does for me mentally or financially.
