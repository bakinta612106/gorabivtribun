During his spell with PSG, the Swede became the club's all-time leading goalscorer and won the Ligue 1 title on four occasions.</p><p>As noted by Bleacher Report, his previous campaign was one to remember, setting remarkably high standards at the Parc des Princes:</p>B/R Football <span class=acct>@brfootball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Zlatan Ibrahimovic 38 goals in just 31 games New single-season record at PSG Ligue 1 Top Goalscorer üèÜ https://t.co/MQqnKn3MOG</p><p>While Ibrahimovic is beyond what many consider to be the traditional peak years of a footballer's career, he only seems to be getting better with age. His touch, technique and ruthlessness in front of goal are all as evident as they've ever been during his playing days.</p><img alt="Ibrahimovic is one of the game's most decorated players." src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/452/320/0ebdc148ea097e64f211a9113eb4bb5f_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/452/320/0ebdc148ea097e64f211a9113eb4bb5f_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption>Ibrahimovic is one of the game's most decorated players.</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>FRANCK FIFE/Getty Images</span><p>The Swede is still one of the finest frontmen around, and he has a canny knack for spearheading league title charges, having won domestic championships with Ajax, Barcelona, Inter Milan, AC Milan and PSG.</p><p><span class=s1>Now, he'll be looking to do the same at Old Trafford. United's last triumph in the league came in 2013, and although former boss Louis van Gaal clinched the FA Cup in the last game of his tenure, the club looked a long way off in pursuit of the Premier League's top spot.</span></p><p><span class=s1>Despite his advancing years, Ibrahimovic can bring a winning mentality to a young team. Players like Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford may find themselves vying with the veteran for a spot in the first XI, but having someone who sets such high standards around the football club will be a huge asset.</span></p><p>Here's a look at what the forward is capable of doing:</p><p>The Old Trafford faithful will be delighted to see Ibrahimovic strutting his stuff on their turf. It's a crowd that's always cherished mercurial footballers, including George Best, Eric Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo. But there are few players in world football who enchant quite like Ibrahimovic does.</p><p>Granted, it's not all good when it comes to Ibrahimovic. His egotistical tendencies aren't to everyone's taste, for example. The veteran said he "came like a king, left like a legend" when assessing his time in the French capital recently, per his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter feed</a>.</p><p>There have been times when Ibrahimovic has lost his temper, too, both on the field and off it. In April 2015, he was hit with a four-game ban following strong criticism of referee <span>Lionel Jaffredo following a 3-2 loss to Bordeaux, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sky Sports</a>.</span></p><img alt="Ibrahimovic is one of the biggest names in world football." src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/452/323/0150c1114afa15a68dc127acaac2f11f_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/452/323/0150c1114afa15a68dc127acaac2f11f_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption>Ibrahimovic is one of the biggest names in world football.</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>CLAUDIO BRESCIANI/TT/Getty Images</span><p>But these edgy flashes have long littered Ibrahimovic's career, and although the Red Devils would prefer it if the forward was placated, it's part of what makes him such an absorbing individual.</p><p>The fact remains that even at 34 years old, Ibrahimovic is one of the best footballers around and a player capable of delivering on the highest stage. For United, he'll be a welcome addition and <span>a huge draw</span> for the Premier League. After all, there are few connoisseurs of the beautiful game who'll flick the channel over when Zlatan is on the field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW5rY2yBdHnZpZitmZ5itqO%2BwKGgpqemnrBuwM5mpJqmk52ytMDEq2SuppmpsqV5y5qrnqukYsGzrc2snZ6qXZmyta3IpapmqpWWsLW1zqdkpqeimg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
