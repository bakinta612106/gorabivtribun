Its creator, Sera Gamble, has teamed up with Berlanti and Alloy Entertainment to bring a new series, “Providence, ” a Caroline Kepnes adaptation, to your screen.</p><p>The new series based on Caroline Kepnes’s books will explore the story of young men who vanish and resurface several years later with <a href=#>supernatural</a> abilities. It has been over a year since Peacock made the series announcement, and this is all there is to know about the Providence series development.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Providence Season 1 Release Date: When will it be airing?</h2><p>So far, we do not have a specific release date for the supernatural series, as the creator and the original network have yet to announce the exact release date. The series episodes, run time, and release schedule will be notified once the series filming has begun or the post-production stage is over. We might binge on the first season before 2023 ends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Providence Season 1 Plot: What should we expect?</h2><p>The Providence series explores the themes of Friendship, love, betrayal, and uncertainty. It tells the story of two young lovers, John and Chloe, individuals who care deeply for one another but have never found the courage to confess how they feel about one another. After Jon finally gathers the courage to tell Chloe how much she means to him, he gets kidnapped by one of his acquaintances, who is also obsessed with saving humanity.</p><p>Several years pass, and John is back with hopes that he will finally reunite with the love of his life. He is, however, surprised when he learns that his supernatural abilities stand in the way of him reuniting with Chloe. Together with the other characters that he got kidnapped with, they set on a journey to understand what happened to them to gain supernatural abilities and why it happened.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Providence Season 1 Cast: Who’ll be in?</h2><p>The cast expected to premiere in season one of the show is yet to be announced, and we are not sure when the announcement will be out. Series usually give out their cast lineup before filming starts, and we hope the Providence series will follow the same schedule.</p><p>The series writer, however, remains known, and Sera Gamble (<a href=#>The Magicians</a>) and Neil Reynolds are charged with adapting and writing the show. The two have a history of writing some of the most successful TV shows. Gamble has Written You, and Reynolds has written The Vampire Diaries and the <a href=#>Doom Patrol</a> series. The two are expected to executively produce the series alongside Greg Berlanti (<a href=#>Supergirl</a>), David Madden, Sarah Schechter, Gina Girolamo, and Leslie Morgenstein.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Providence Season 1 Trailer: When can we watch it?</h2><p>It has been over a year since the announcement of the series development was made, but we have yet to receive any updates regarding the series trailer and when we should expect it to be out. The possible timeline of the series trailer release date is before 2024, but we hope the distribution channel will update us on the official dates soon. As you wait for the series premiere, you can check out other Sera Gambles projects like you, a series with four seasons premiering on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK57z6umr6GUmruksYysnJqrn6N6s7HLnpisnV2ZrrWxjJyYrKxdpbmwwIyup52ZpJp6tb7AoqOeql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
