Rory McIlroy extended his lead to four strokes with his round of 70. It didn't look like McIlroy could get anything going up until the 17th hole where he holed a long birdie putt and gave a confident fist pump.
Jason Day failed to compete with McIlroy, shooting an even par 72. Day had his share of birdies all day, however, he also backed them up with bogeys."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He, however, remains a long shot and will require a spectacular round on Sunday for a victory.&nbsp;</p><p>After the spectacular round on Friday, <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a> could not find any consistency with his putter. He shot a 74. He will need a great round tomorrow to fight his way back into contention. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Phil Mickelson</a> needed a big round today to get back into contention. This did not happen, however, Mickelson shot a 71 and remains nine shots off the lead. He will need a minor miracle for his fourth green jacket.&nbsp;</p><p>The leaderboard for this year's Masters has many great stories, Sunday should be a spectacular afternoon of golf. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobW5xZ2iBbrnArKueqqNif3F9kGajnpmUmr%2Bju8Crm2acka56dHnAZpqoraChsm67xWaqmqylp7GixYympq%2Bdoqh6orrDZqqhmZuav7Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
